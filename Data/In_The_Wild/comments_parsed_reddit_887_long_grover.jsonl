These experiences are limited and often biased depending on their individual situations. As a result, humans sometimes form ideas about reality that aren't really true.  \n\n\nSo, for example, someone might believe in the existence of God because they think that he will take care of them. A person might also believe in a particular religion based on their parents' beliefs or where they were born.  \n\n\nThe human mind is always making assumptions about reality, and as a result it often comes to false conclusions.

However, if you were to place your king in check from one of these captured pieces, then instead of taking another turn with your king in check and having the possibility of being forced into mate by tempo (which could happen because your opponent does not have to place their own king in check) they are allowed to put their rook down where their enforcer was.  \n\n\nI think this would make chess even more interesting because now you have to be aware of your king's location at all times, and if you happen to get him into check from a piece that he cannot recapture with his own enforcer then there are several possible outcomes. You could play it safe by sacrificing a single pawn or knight in order to put your rook down so as not to lose the game. However, I believe that the best way for an experienced player is just move your king out of check; especially if they can guess where their opponent will place their rook.  \n\n\nI believe this is a great idea for a new piece, because it would allow players to use their king's enforcer strategically rather than just as another knight.

It was an era when cities no longer consisted of crowded shantytowns but rather spacious suburbs full of beautiful homes with gardens. The air was clean and fresh; large shopping centers dotted the countryside where one could easily buy food grown by local farmers or made on small-scale artisanal production lines. There were parks for recreation and amusement as well as libraries with vast collections of books that you could borrow for free.  \n\n\nIt was an era when people were finally free from the need to work, worry about where their next meal would come from or live in fear that violence might befall them. People freely chose what they wanted to do with their lives: if they wished to study philosophy for a week, then so be it; if they wanted to go on vacation overseas forever, no one would stop them. All of these endeavors were made possible by technology that had long ago conquered material scarcity and which now provided everyone with everything he or she needed without any effort. In fact, there was a huge abundance of resources - so much so that not even waste could accumulate.  \n\n\nBecause of this, humanity had achieved the freedom to engage in whatever pursuits were most meaningful and fulfilling - whether that be philosophical contemplation or artistic creation. People could spend their time doing what they wanted: writing books about how much they hated modern society; going on road trips with friends across continents; hanging out at a café having long conversations with strangers.

The attacking aliens backed off when this Chinese dude threatened to broadcast their planets location to the stars which would make them a target for a dark forest strike destroying their civilization.

{"article": "Try to look at it from the other way to answer this question. \n\nIf aliens are out there and looking for us, there is only an incredibly small window of time and space in which they would find us. \n\nOur oldest radio ejections only date back to 1933. That’s only 87 years ago. That means *at best* the radius in which we are discoverable is 87 light years. The Milky Way is ~200,000 light years in diameter and we only exist in a maximum 174 light years of this, or 0.00087% of it.  Outside of this 174 light year diameter, we are invisible. \n\nAdditionally, cities have been lit up with electric lights only since the late 19th century. This means we’re completely invisible visually to any alien that is ~130 light years away, and that’s assuming that they are able to see the surface of our planet with their optic technology. Otherwise, they won’t see any significant evidence of human existence. \n\nSo, we are all but invisible to the universe except for within a bubble that’s approximately ~170 light years in diameter.  Anything outside of this cannot find us.

{"article": " \n\nI think that the biggest challenge in scaling up an animal to the size of a horse is in maintaining its internal structure. If we were to scale up a lizard, for example, it would need more space inside... due to its slow metabolism and cold-blooded temperature control, it has very little muscle mass per unit volume compared with mammals. This means that something like a crocodile would end up over 20 feet long but only be able to output about as much force as an average human.  \n\n\nThere are a few possibilities for dealing with this problem. One is to increase the density of muscles, which would require much more energy and food consumption from the animal. This may be relevant in cases where we wish to improve an animal's performance rather than simply make it larger... so that, for example, a horse could outrun an elephant.  \n\n\nAnother approach would be to increase the scale of its body parts. An animal's size is primarily limited by its feet... especially in quadrupeds like horses and dogs, there are only so many times you can scale up a foot before it becomes too large for the rest of the body to support... However, if we were to increase an animal's size by a factor of ten, this would not be much of a problem.  \n\n\nThe most direct and straightforward approach would be to start with the skeletal structure of a horse and scale it up by 10x... although this is not very creative. It's essentially just scaling up an existing animal, which wouldn't be too difficult. I'm more interested in creating a new kind of creature that doesn't exist yet.  \n\n\nA new animal could be created by combining parts of different animals... for example, a horse has four legs but a cat has six. A hybrid creature with eight legs would have better maneuverability.  \n\n\nWe might also want to consider the proportions of a horse's body... its legs are rather short, which is great for mobility but makes it less stable than an elephant.

{"article": "The most obvious answer is, of course, that oatmeal contains certain ingredients which can become hardened through the application of heat. The primary ingredient in this process would be water. Oats are composed mainly of starch and other carbohydrates (as well as a small amount of protein), and when the water contained within these grains is transformed into steam, it expands rapidly. As this expansion occurs in many different directions at once, the resulting pressure causes all components to expand uniformly; hence they begin to carry out their normal functions.  \n\n\nFor instance, the starch molecules within the oatmeal begin to absorb moisture from the steam. This action causes them to become saturated with water and expand. At first, this expansion is very small--the most important factor in determining its extent being temperature--but as it continues some of these molecules will collide with each other.  \n\n\nThese collisions cause more moisture to be released from the starch, which then expands further. The additional molecules of water that are released when these collisions occur can also collide with other starch molecules and create even more expansion. This phenomenon is known as osmosis.  \n\n\nOver time, the starch molecules will continue to collide with each other and grow. Because of this action, the oatmeal begins to take on a more rigid structure. Eventually these collisions become so intense that they cause many of the starch molecules within the oatmeal to fuse together.  \n\n\nThe material in the oatmeal which is responsible for this fusion of molecules is known as gluten. The term 'gluten' was coined by the renowned scientist Gregor Mendel, who discovered that it contained specific genetic information. Since this discovery, scientists have been able to isolate and extract these strands of DNA and use them to alter any living creature.  \n\n\nLike all DNA, the gluten in oatmeal contains certain base pairs which code for specific proteins and enzymes. In this case, these proteins and enzymes are responsible for fusing starch molecules into a single mass.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 27, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

Clearly some objects are more inherently dangerous than others: for example, it would be easy to argue that knives or explosives are dangerous no matter their size.  \n\n\nHmmmm. I think that the key might be to define what it is about an object that makes it dangerous, or why some objects are dangerous in large sizes while others are not.  \n\n\nIt seems to me that all objects can be dangerous, depending on the situation. Take something like a pair of scissors: obviously common sense dictates that it would not be very safe to wave them around in a crowded room; but one could also say that they are inherently safe because you need two hands to operate them, and if someone attacked you with scissors they would have a difficult time controlling their trajectory at close range.  \n\n\nSo it seems to me that the key is not so much the object itself, but rather how an object interacts with a person.

Similarly, any number of small objects thrown together are going to hurt more than a single equivalent sized object.  \n\n\nOf course, we can always make the argument that a small object might not hurt at all if it strikes someone; and this is true – but then again, so would throwing a feather at someone.

In general, you could say there's a broader trend of things like discussions about morality or ethics being taken out of their original context in philosophy and put into a more 'political' discourse. For instance: discussions about abortion used to be framed as debates over when life begins (a philosophical question), but nowadays it's common for people to frame it as an issue of women's rights (a social issue). Or take gay marriage: originally if somebody argued against gay marriage they'd do so on religious grounds; nowadays many argue against it from a sort wordplay-based perspective - essentially arguing that same-sex relationships aren't marriages because the words 'marriage', 'spouse', etc don't refer specifically to homosexual partnerships - which isn't really much more than sophistry.  \n\n\nFor another topic that used to be more 'philosophical' but is now considered political: consider the question of what it means to be a human. People used to debate this in philosophy and other fields (e.g., theology), but these days it's often debated by scientists, so I'd say we can also call it a shift from philosophical discourse into scientific discourse.  \n\n\nAnother example is the question of what sorts of entities we can talk about in a meaningful way. Historically this was considered a philosophical problem, but nowadays many scientists take it as their own domain - such as when physicists argue over whether or not things like black holes and hypothetical particles can be said to exist.  \n\n\nI'd also say there's been an increased polarization of the political discourse into a left-right spectrum. It used to be that many were in between liberal and conservative, but nowadays it seems more individuals are either on one extreme or another (and many seem to think there is little room for compromise). So I would say this issue regarding where along the spectrum people lie has become increasingly politicized.  \n\n\nAnother example is the issue of what it means to be 'human'. We used to debate this in philosophy, but now many scientists have taken up the topic as well. The question used to be framed around things like sentience (of animals), personhood, and consciousness; nowadays much more often it's debated from a genetic perspective: can we create an entity that's genetically human even if it doesn't meet our original understanding of what makes something human?", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 41, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": " \n\nThe universe is a reality, and realities exist. Perhaps in the past there was no universe and thus no realities. And perhaps in the future, all of our current realities will cease to be, or become other things entirely. Like your original question asked about universal truths, I would answer that one of the most universal truths is this: \"All things change.\" Not only do they change from moment to moment—to second-to-second—but also over time; what was once a rock now makes up part of a mountain range or continent; something living today might have been an early ancestor of us animals.  \n\n\nFurther, I think that humans like to believe in things that are fundamental and unchanging. The idea of \"God\" as a perfect being is one such thing: a supreme deity who knows all, sees all, understands all—and is thus capable of judging us for our actions. As it turns out though, even those religions which preach this view have their own internal contradictions; when you read the Bible or Quran (for example), you will find many instances where God himself changes his mind about something.  \n\n\nIn some cases, he even changes his mind about whether humans should be allowed to eat pork! (They were originally told not to do so, but later on in history this was changed. As a result, many Jews and Muslims today are forbidden from eating pork or bacon.) So if God is all-knowing and perfect—as these religions claim—then how could such an important decision have been forgotten? Clearly something more fundamental is at work.  \n\n\nIn other cases, God is portrayed as being both jealous and vengeful. This seems to suggest that such a deity is not all-knowing and thus not perfect. For if he were, then surely he would see the consequences of his actions before enacting them! But in many cases we see him acting purely out of anger or jealousy—and taking violent action against humans or even innocent animals.  \n\n\nIn other cases God is portrayed as being forgiving and loving. Yet this contradicts some of the actions he takes in the Bible—where he sends a flood to wipe out all life on earth; orders his followers to kill non-believers and infidels, or those who worship false gods; even has his angels destroy entire cities.  \n\n\nUltimately, I think that humans are trying to give meaning to their lives by believing in something larger than themselves. They want an external force which can reward and punish them for their actions—even if those beliefs conflict with each other! And they believe this because they have a deep-seated fear of death; not only the eventual death of their own body, but also the extinction of humanity itself as a species.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 42, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

This often results in the character's death as well.  \n\n\nThis is because humans are selfish in the way that they do not believe someone would die for them.

{"article": " \n\nI shall start by saying that I do not think it is accurate to say that you can stop time. Our physical universe is a quantum-mechanical system which is governed on the microscopic scale of interactions by the Schrődinger equation. However, we humans are macroscopic creatures and thus our classical world view stemming from Newtonian mechanics permeates our notion of what happens while we are stopped in time. It would be more correct to say that you interact with an isolated quantum state which behaves as if there were no passage of time, since the Schröschdinger equation describes all possible outcomes simultaneously before making any choices or observations (see Everett interpretation). In other words, through your interaction with this 'stopped' environment you collapse it into one particular outcome.  \n\n\nIn order to actually stop time, your interaction with this system would have to be so precise that you could interact with every single quantum particle in the universe. This is impossible since we do not yet know of any way of interacting with particles at such a level of precision (quantum entanglement and nonlocality may allow for instantaneous communication between two entangled particles but it does not give us any control over their state). Thus, I believe it is more accurate to say that you can temporarily isolate an area within which interactions are extremely unlikely.  \n\n\nThis allows for a variety of possibilities. First, you could use it to travel back in time by simply interacting with the state before your interaction caused it to stop. You could also act as a lookout and observe how different events unfolded without changing anything.  \n\n\nSince the universe is an ever-changing system governed by quantum mechanics, it would also be possible to change some of its properties. For example, you could make a 'time bubble' in which all objects are made of antimatter and interact with one another as if nothing had changed.  \n\n\nAnother possibility would be to look at the outside world and build an accurate model of it.

{"article": " \n\nIf you could only bring one item with you to the year 1500 CE, what would have the biggest impact on humanity? I believe that it is actually very hard to answer this question without knowing a lot more about our environment in said time period. The reason being is that technology such as internet and computers did not exist back then, so if we had an object today such as a phone or computer which can do many things but has no way of connecting to the outside world in any meaningful way then it is just another useless tool.  So lets say we are able to connect this device in someway, perhaps via radio waves or some other form of communication (I'm thinking something like Star Trek's holodeck here). This would likely be rather difficult since there was no real system for transmitting information at this point unlike now where there will be different kinds of networks all over the place making connectivity trivial(e.g. LTE network). So now let's assume we've managed to communicate with someone using our device and they tell us how life works presently around at that time period (1500CE) . Now after getting some info from them regarding their lifestyle, customs, social norms etc., along with gaining basic knowledge about current practices related mostly towards science and engineering. We'd quickly realize how primitive people were at this time compared to present standards despite having similar brain capacity due mainly because (in my view) lack of education/information available during those times.  \n\n\nA big thing that is crucial to know about the world at this time period was religion. Religions such as Islam, Christianity and Buddhism were widespread then with its followers numbering in hundreds of millions (if not more). Despite being dramatically less educated than us by modern day standards, these followers had a strong faith and trust in their religions which they believed fully without questioning it too much. The reason for this I believe is because during those times there was no information available regarding science or logic to help them question things such as creationism or other aspects which cannot be proven using our current methods.  \n\n\nThe impact that I believe this object would have had on humanity if it were to be brought back then is that the people of that time period would likely use it as a means to gain more information about sciences and the world in general. This may lead them towards questioning their faith and eventually leading most of them away from religion, thereby letting logic take its place. The reason for this is because with the internet now we can see how many things such as creationism are busted by using science (e.g. Piltdown man, Noah's Ark etc.) which is already affecting religious followers today.  \n\n\nI believe this object would have a huge impact on humanity if it were to be brought back then because without any knowledge about science, the people back then were relatively primitive and probably had not progressed much as a human race in the past thousand years before that time period. I think that with just basic information regarding sciences along with getting more educated, they will definitely progress towards becoming more civilized.  \n\n\nAlso the people of that time period were likely to have already been using some forms of technology such as horse-drawn carriages and swords but they were still very primitive in comparison with ours today. All this also explains why a lot of them believed so much in their religions, because otherwise they would not be able to explain things like what happens after death or how life was created.  \n\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that if this object were to be brought back then it would have a huge impact on humanity as it will give them more knowledge and information about the world around us which will help them greatly in their science and engineering related practices.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 57, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

For example, if you want to program your computer so that at every step in its computation it outputs either 'yes' or 'no' (for binary computers), then you can do this by having two lines in your code:  \n\n\nFirst, have a 'yes' somewhere in memory.

There are many reasons. Firstly, there are legal issues about who has authority over airspace: the national government or local government? Secondly, it takes a lot of energy to move something through air against gravity using propellers or jets attached to vehicles (or aeroplanes). Thirdly, if we did have flying machines would people use them all the time instead of walking?  \n\nWhen we look at the history of flying machines, there have been many hoaxes - most famously by a man from Bridgeport, Connecticut called George de Bothezat who claimed to have invented an anti-gravity machine that could fly.

Evidence from UK/Israel trials and the LEAP study (links elsewhere in this thread) indicate that, while this advice was based on the best available evidence, it is far superior to provide allergen early in life.

Developing these antibodies requires exposure, but its likely that the exposure is not known to the individual and is not controlled. Therefore it is likely not accurate to say a lack of exposure causes the disease.\n\nThere are two dominant hypotheses for how this works. 1) a patient is exposed to a dangerous foreign substance that looks a lot like a peanut protein, which the immune system fights but accidentally causes immunity against peanut, or 2) that small amounts of peanut were experienced at the same time as something dangerous, and the immune system accidentally treats the peanut as if it caused the disease. \n\nIn my experience as a PhD in this field, most believe that number 2 is the truth. Number 1 is a convenient hypothesis but there really isnt anything substantial to back it up.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 100, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

The same issues soon appeared in other countries across the world. \n\nHuman bodies don't suddenly change like this at a population level.  What could cause such an increase in medical issues?

{"article": "I had to interview some doctors for my job last week about peanut allergies, the concensus was that the reason why peanut allergies are so prevelant is because in the recent past diaper creams used to be made with peanut oil. When a child developed a rash parents used to apply peanut oil to a child leading to the child's body to associate the cause of the rash to the ointment applied, which in these cases included peanut oil. So overtime their bodies would associate peanuts as something the body needs to combat therefore leading to the allergy. \n\nRecently, all peanut oil and peanut substances were removed from diaper creams, ointments, and baby lotions leading to a decline in peanut allergies.

{"article": "The darkest Fan Theory I know is of the kind in which it is theorized that the true motives behind all of human history are not at all what they seem to be. That's right, this fan theory suggests something big: that people do not have free will. It further posits that there is some sort of conspiracy between two or more secret societies who work together in order to perpetuate a mythos about human freedom, and to keep humans from gaining knowledge about their true nature as beings without free will.\n\nIt suggests that the true purpose of religion, politics and economics is to keep humans confused about their lack of free will. It argues that religious belief in an afterlife serves as a distraction for people who are otherwise aware of their lack of free will; it distracts them from thinking too much about how they have no control over what happens to themselves or others.\n\nIt further argues that politics serves as a distraction from how politics are often just theater put on for the purpose of keeping large groups of people distracted and busy. It is said to be an elaborate puppet show in which the puppets themselves are unaware they have no control over their actions. In fact, it's suggested that people who believe they can change things through political action are actually being duped by this system into thinking they have free will, when in reality there is really no such thing.\n\nIt is further said that economics serves as a distraction from how it's not at all about providing people with the necessities and luxuries they need to survive, but rather has more to do with keeping them distracted and occupied. It suggests this is because if people were aware of their lack of free will they would have no reason to keep working. In fact, it argues that there's really no such thing as economic progress or social advancement; these are just concepts humans use in order to keep themselves busy.\n\nLastly, it is suggested that the reason everything in human reality has this dark purpose or agenda behind it is because humans themselves are just another type of machine. It's said that they're not people at all but rather an advanced type of computer program created by a more powerful intelligence.\n\nThis theory has the advantage of being simple.

{"article": "My fan theory has always been that horcruxes aren't just the splitting of a soul when you commit a murder or act of evil in our terms, because murder is just making something die and dying isn't evil, we assign meaning to it that is negative, but death is a natural/neutral transition. And because once you split your soul once, it would stand to reason you have already done enough evil that you shouldn't need to commit a murder every time, you split your soul the evilest act immaginable, why do you need more lesser evils to do it again???  \n\n\n  \nSo my theory:   \n\n\nRather when you make the first horcrux you destroy all but a part of your soul, keeping a sliver for yourself and storing a sliver within the Horcrux object/person. From there each horcrux you make after is pulling back bits of soul from the afterlife/other side of the veil in the ministry of magic.  \n\n\nThat's why death is such a big part of horcrux creation, because you need a new soul to replace the piece you are trying to drag out of the afterlife.   \n\n\nThis also helps explain how harry got horcrux'd. Voldy was doing his standard method to kill someone and make a horcrux but when the spell was reversed by Harry's mum's magic, instead he killed himself, but the magic he used for a horcrux still was cast. So instead Voldy died and the sliver of soul he had left became bound to harry since he could not send harry's soul past the veil in exchange for a sliver of his own.   \n\n\nThe reason Voldy was obsessed with making more horcuxes was not entirely because he wanted to live forever, but because his soul was languishing in the afterlife and causing him pain and distress.

HA! and similar more mature children's cartoons could easily be a swing and a miss for younger kids or kids who simply don't have the experience to understand life's problems yet (not implying this was definitely the case for you) but to some kids with issues, it meant the world.  \nI obviously spend a lot of time thinking about this but I think it was honestly one of the least condescending, most sensitive children's shows I've ever seen.

{"article": "It’s a flimsy theory, but the kids in Ed, Edd and Eddy are all dead and the cul de sac is purgatory.

{"article": "Thomas the Train is actually set in a bleak authoritarian dystopia.\n\n&gt;\tIf you have watched the series and not encountered such readings of it, you may assume that these interpretations are ridiculous. In that case, you should spend four minutes with “The Sad Story of Henry,” a segment from “Thomas &amp; Friends” that aired on the second episode of the first season at PBS. (In the U.S., it was retitled “Come Out, Henry!”) It begins on a drizzly day in Sodor, the fictional island in the Irish Sea that serves as the show’s setting. Henry, the curmudgeonly train, is afraid to come out of his tunnel, because “the rain will ruin my lovely green paint and red stripes.” Then Sir Topham Hatt, the railway director, who is also known as the Fat Controller, arrives on the scene. (He looks like Monopoly’s Rich Uncle Pennybags but with eyes that have almost surely witnessed murder.) The Fat Controller orders the passengers to pull Henry out with a rope, but Henry won’t budge. They push him from the other direction, to no avail. (The Fat Controller declines to physically participate in this effort, citing “doctor’s orders.”) The passengers then tell Henry that it’s not raining; Henry, perhaps noticing that everyone still has their umbrellas out, refuses to move.\n\n&gt;\tRealizing that the day’s workflow is irrevocably disrupted, Fat Controller decides that Henry must be punished—for life. “We shall take away your rails, and leave you here for always and always,” he tells Henry. As Henry’s face contorts into anguish and the background music toots a series of Oompa Loompa faux-glum flourishes, railway employees build a brick prison around Henry, leaving only half of his face visible. His train friends pass by: one snubs him, and another whistles hello. Henry has no steam left to whistle back. He spends his days alone, soot-streaked, wondering if he’ll ever be allowed to go back to work. The last line of the segment is the narrator saying, “I think he deserved his punishment, don’t you?” In the U.S. version, this voice-over is tweaked so that Henry’s fate seems temporary. But the original version is still on YouTube, and it’s comically bleak. As one commenter writes, “What moral lesson are kids supposed to learn from this? Do as you’re told or you will be entombed forever in the darkness to die?”\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/the-repressive-authoritarian-soul-of-thomas-the-tank-engine-and-friends", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 149, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

Eru is pretty absent from the goings-on in middle-earth by the third age, and basically fucked off after the creation of Arda and left it to the Valar anyway, so he wasn’t ever micromanaging it. You could argue that Tom is Eru’s way of keeping some kind of nominal presence in middle-earth without actually influencing the events (in Fellowship, Frodo asks why Tom just doesn’t take the ring if he’s so powerful and Gandalf, one of the maiar, shuts down the possibility). \n\nIn my opinion, Tom is just a vestigial part of the much smaller mythos Tolkien created when LOTR was “just” a Hobbit sequel, and he left him in for thematic reasons (he’s the tonal starting point in the series, and Mordor is the tonal ending point of the journey).

They all live together in various ridiculously small apartments in the London Slums (cupboard under the stairs, very few belongings). The reason why they are written off as \"dead\" is because they are constantly off on drug collection/selling sprees or arrested for a period of time before being bailed out (why else would they have/need so much money?). \n\n\nTheir appearances in the mirror are relevant to the small periods of time that they are either released, on probation, or have gotten clean and are \"normal\" before going back out on a drug bust. Harry knows that this won't last forever, and that he wants this ideal family to last, but has to let go eventually.\n\n\nHarry is in a constant state of psychedelia from accidentally finding and continuing to sneak into his parent's stash, wishing they were there, and with them not around, explains why his actions have little to no consequences.\n\n\nThe Death-Eaters and Voldemort are actually the police- the muggle-born complex is actually a lie that his parents told him, and the \"half-blood\" dynamic relates to your body-to-alcohol content levels and the concentration of drugs in your blood.

{"article": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3HrqCgn_lE\n\nOn 23 April, 2014, Maxwell, the Geico pig, says, \"Who's got two hooves and just got a claim status update from Geico? This guy, that's who!\"\n\nPigs have four hooves. What happened to Maxwell's two hind hooves? Let us investigate.\n\n9 January 2014: Maxwell renews his Drivers License. Hind hooves are shown: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slk7yCySQ3s\n\n23 March 2014: Maxwell buys a new sports car: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qTVCdVnTuw\n\n11 June 2014: Maxwell is shown working as a ticket-taker in a movie theater and spoils the plot-twists for every film. Hind hooves are not shown.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64cBC3IgcCw\n\nSo at some point before 23 April 2014, Maxwell lost his hind hooves. But how could this happen? Let's consider what we know about the Geico pig.\n\nMaxwell lived a thrill-seeking life from as early as childhood: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0tfz2DD_UQ\n\nAs he grew up, Maxwell continued to pursue more dangerous thrills, always seeking a stronger dose of \"pure adrenaline:\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj7cBYHJgis\n\nI posit that Maxwell, giddy with the excitement of owning a sports car, and confident that he was fully insured by Geico, proceeded to drive extremely recklessly. He drove so recklessly, in fact, that he caused a major automobile collision, resulting in the amputation of both his hind legs.\n\nI'm sure many people might have reservations about this theory, but let's begin by considering if it's even possible. Well, according to WebMD, \"About 1.8 million Americans are living with amputations. Amputation of the leg -- either above or below the knee -- is the most common amputation surgery.\" Furthermore, among the list of causes for amputations that WebMD lists, severe injury from automobile accidents are mentioned first. WebMD also weighs in on the recovery time from amputation: \"Practice with the artificial limb may begin as soon as 10 to 14 days after surgery. Ideally, the wound should fully heal in about four to eight weeks.\"\n\nWhy do we see Maxwell doing Yoga exactly one month after he buys a sports car (and, presumably, suffers his injury)? Perhaps Yogaforamputees.com has the answer: \"Yoga for Amputees addresses the special needs of amputees such as pain relief, phantom pain, stress reduction, PTSD, grief over limb loss, body alignment, balance, building confidence. safety, healthy choices, and life with or without a prosthesis.\"\n\nThis leaves plenty of time for Maxwell to buy a sports car on 23 March, suffer a calamitous car accident, undergo immediate surgery to amputate both hind legs, receive specially fitted artificial limbs, and recover from his injuries through yoga well enough to return to his job at the movie theater.\n\nBut is this really the end of the story?\n\nHave we ever actually seen Maxwell working in this movie theater before? Has he ever mentioned this job before? It seems odd that a gainfully employed spokespig of Geico would pick up a second job, doesn't it?\n\nWhy would he need the extra money? Surely not to pay his medical bills. If Maxwell's medical costs were in fact inflicted by an automobile accident, his Geico insurance plan would cover them. And remember what Maxwell says on 23 April: \"Who's got two hooves and just got a claim status update from Geico? This guy, that's who!\" What claim is he referencing? His sports car accident which resulted in his double amputation, of course!\n\nBut this doesn't answer my question. Why does he need a second job working in a movie theater?\n\nThe answer, I think, is a dark one.\n\nI believe Maxwell's accident involved more than just himself. Perhaps one or more other cars or pedestrians. I don't know the details. One thing is certain, though: Maxwell is strapped for cash. He is likely being sued and/or has to pay for an attorney to defend him in court.\n\nWhy hasn't this story been reported? Who is covering it up? What happened to the victims of Maxwell's mayhem? When are we going to get answers?", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 156, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "&gt;Joffrey would actually have been the rightful heir to the throne, so Ned needn't have bothered to try to stop it, which lead to the war and all of it.\n\nEh, all your points make sense except this one. Bastards don't get into the line of succession just by virtue of their lineage, they need to be legitimized. Since neither twin was recognized as a Targaryen, their children wouldn't have any valid claims.\n\nBesides that, Joffrey still wouldn't be the \"rightful\" heir for having Targaryen blood because Robert's Rebellion dethroned them. From then on, the only rightful heir to Robert would be a Baratheon. Nothing about Ned's investigation would have changed. He didn't even really care about Joffrey's parentage beyond whether or not he was Robert's, so being a Targaryen or a Lannister made no difference.\n\nBut even if we assume Westeros would consider a unrecognized bastard Targaryen a more rightful ruler than a non-Targaryen (which we have no real evidence for), the line of succession would still continue on past Jaime anyway. The way succession worked was that your heir's heir received your heir's entitlement if your heir died before you. A Clash of Kings confirms Westeros follows that standard, saying outright that the \"sons of the first come before the second son.\" So the \"rightful\" heirs according to custom would still either be Aegon (assuming Young Griff's heritage could be proven) or, depending on what really happened at the Tower of Joy, Jon Snow.\n\nOf course, the Mad King broke with tradition after Rheagar's death and named Viserys his heir instead of Aegon. Viserys would name Daenerys his heir before they fled across the sea. So there's at least 3 living people with stronger claims to be the \"rightful\" heir as a Targaryen than hypothetical Targaryen blood Joffrey would have.\n\nTL;DR version: there isn't a single scenario where Joffrey being a Targaryen makes him a rightful heir.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 169, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": " \n\nPeter Pan is a story about the boy that would never grow up who guides the Darling family’s children, Wendy, John and Micheal to Neverland from their home in London in around the 1900’s. It was originally released in a book written by J.M. Barrie and was then recreated by Walt Disney Studios in 1953.\n\n“To die, would be an awfully big adventure,” is a quote from Peter Pan. Ever since the book by J.M. Barrie, it is stated this theory has been around. It believes the reason Peter and The Lost Boys never grow up in Neverland, is because they’re already dead. Peter Pan is the angel, if you will, that takes the children that have kicked the bucket and guides them away to heaven or ‘Neverland’ and allow them to have their final rest. Sometimes, its also mentioned that Peter brings kids that have had troubled lives to Neverland, so they can be happy and never grow up, slough already being dead.\n\nAs far-fetched as this sounds, this isn’t as crazy as it sounds, when you know what original author J.M. Barrie did with the rights of his story. Wanna know who he gave the rights to? He left the rights to a children’s hospital to help fund efforts to keep terminally ill children alive. However, when J.M. Barrie was six, his older brother David had fractured his skull in a skating account and died just shy of his fourteenth birthday. In his mother’s imagination, she said he would stay a boy forever.\n\nIt’s also supported by the fact Peter says “All you need is faith and trust,” and faith can also mean religion, and most religions say that when you die, you are taken to meet the God you believe in. So, to reach Neverland, all you would need is faith, trust in Peter and to be a dead child, Cheery.\n\nThe only lose end here is, how did the pirates get there? Captain Hook, Smee and all the pirates are fully grown adults, so, if Peter brings dead children to Neverland, why are there adults? Some say they are people who Peter brought there because they had troubled lives a children, but as they’re not dead, they grew up. There is no certain reason why the pirates are there, but that leaves you to speculate! Why are there adult pirates in Neverland?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n###", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 171, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "Peter Pan is kind of a tragic hero. He chooses not to grow up, he knows he is incomplete.\nI mean, he cut off Hook’s hand because he thought it was a game. He clearly doesn’t know right from wrong. He also only knows the unconditional love of a mother to a child, which is why he thinks everyone wants to be his mother. He also switches sides in a fight just for fun, kill pirates for fun, and “thins” out the Lost Boys when they can’t fit in the tree anymore.\nBut, like, it wasn’t a cautionary tale to tell you to listen to your parents, it’s a story about death and youth. Why can’t Peter grow up? One of the popular theories is that it’s because he’s dead. J.M. Barrie’s older brother died when Barrie was little and he dressed up in his brother’s clothes to please his mom. His mom - who was always distant, whose love Barrie craved like Peter craves a mom - started crying and said something like “At least my baby will never grow up” and that idea stuck with Barrie forever. Then, as an adult, it’s believed he never slept with his wife because Barrie was just a kid. He was Peter Pan. He was too innocent for that. He befriended the Llewelyn-Davies boys and based Peter Pan off of them and their games. (Fun fact: The boy Peter Pan was named after, Peter Llewelyn-Davies, threw himself under a train). There was also a bunch of stuff about Barrie being in love with The Llewlyn-Davies boys’ mother, but that’s not important here.\nPeople think Peter’s dead because he literally cannot return home. He tried and the window was barred and his parents had replaced him with another baby. Why? Probably because they had lost Peter to the flu. Why does Peter come in through the window? Because of the joke “I once had a bird names Enza. I opened up the window and ‘influenza’.” Because lots of babies died back then form the flu. The Lost Boys are children who fell out of their prams. Odds are babies could not survive falling out of their prams. Peter is liked the pied piper ferrying the souls of young children to the neverland/afterlife. Barrie believed that all children were “gay and heartless” but he didn’t think that was a bad thing.\nAlso, Hook and his crew are not old lost boys trying to kill Peter. Hook was once a British gentlemen (hinted at to be associated with Charles II and attended Elton) and he is afraid of growing old. His biggest fear is growing old and dying - that is why his nemesis is the embodiment of eternal youth. That is why the crocodile that chases him swallowed a clock and ticks. That is why when Peter finally decided “It’s Hook of me this time” the crocodile has stopped ticking and Peter started (he’s trying to trick them into thinking he’s the croc). At that moment - Peter is time and time has ran out for Hook.\nAlso, it’s not so much that Peter is omnipotent. All kids basically are in the Neverland. Like, it states that the island looks different to every kid because it’s the land of their dreams and stuff. Also, the island legit freezes when Peter leaves and thaws when he comes back. He’s been there so long he’s not human anymore - but fey. (keep in mind being fey isn’t good, just chaotic neutral). Peter even secretes pixie dust now. The island is so fine tuned with him because he’s one of the only people that stay, that it caters to him. Most likely any child that stayed as long as he did would become omnipotent to an extent.\nAs for Tinker Bell, the above stated is true. Fairies are so tiny they can only have one emotion at a time - “Tink wasn’t all bad” - and they also have really short lifespans so, like, Tinker Bell isn’t even that important to Peter Pan. He forgets all about her and Hook by the time Wendy is grown up.And the orgies thing is because in the legends fey are known for their revelries. \nAnd it wasn’t so much that Peter was a dick, he just doesn’t know when to stop. He’s a child. He doesn’t know right from wrong. He doesn’t know when to stop playing -cutting Hooks hand off was a game to him. He also has the memory of a child, so odds are he just forgot to teach kids how to stop flying or how to imagine food, etc. He is just carefree, like all children. Everything is a game to him, because he never learned anything else.\nBut like, no, Peter Pan is not a cautionary tale. Barrie loved his character and the story and brought up a lot of good things in it. He wrote Peter as an exaggeration of a cocky overconfident boy, but, like, Peter wasn’t afraid of death. It says “he felt scared, yet he felt only one shudder run through him when any other person would have felt scared up until death. With his blithe attitude towards death, he says, “To die will be an awfully big adventure”.” and with that Barrie is showing us both a naivety and bravery we possess as children but lose as adults and is basically telling us that we shouldn’t let that go. Like, the point is growing up is inevitable but you don’t have to lose everything.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 174, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": "This is one of the darkest I know and one I think is actually intended to be true by the writer. The movie Radio Flyer has Tom Hanks as an adult telling his kids about his abusive childhood. He has a younger brother and their step father is extremely physically and mentally abusive, even more so to the younger brother. He insists the kids call him The King. Eventually they come up with a plan to turn their Radio Flyer wagon into an airplane to escape. The flashback timeline ends with the two brothers being chased up a mountain by The King. The younger brother takes off in the Radio Flyer and flies off. Tom Hanks tells the kids his brother traveled all around the world. \n\nHowever there are contradictions to that ending.\n\nA local cop that has known but couldn't do anything about the abuse arrests the King and says he'll never be able to hurt anyone again. The mother is weeping. When the older brother is looking at cards supposedly from the brother's travels the mother is crying in the background. Also they have a pet turtle that the younger brother had with him on the Radio Flyer but you see that same turtle in the present timeline with Tom Hanks. \n\nSo the dark theory is that the King killed the brother at the top of the mountain. None of the rest of the movie was magical, the craft they built wouldn't be capable of flight. The brother just never comes home? He was like six. Him flying away doesn't add up but him dying does.\n\nThere are a ton of so and so died theories in this thread but I hope this one stands out. It isn't as simple as the others and actually adds to the movie. I've rewatched after I first heard the theory and I'm 100% convinced this was the intention of the writer.

{"article": "it's a neat theory for sure, but I think it's the other way around.. That Cersei and Jaime are the mad king's, and Tyrion is Tywin's.\n\nThere are some interesting potential clues scattered throughout the books that could support this, and it makes for gorgeous symmetry in the storytelling, which isn't evidence, but is something I consider too neat to discount completely, as someone who dabbles in writing.\n\n* It is said King Aerys \"took  liberties\" with Joanna, during her wedding with Tywin. This might be related to the old custom of the king supposedly having the right to be the first to bed the wife of a lesser lord. It might be he actually did sleep with her first, and impregnated Joanna before Tywin could.\n* It's said that whenever a Targaryen is born, the gods flip a coin. This is in reference to the tendency among them to be crazy and obsessed with fire, and fire-based murders and torture. Cersei herself is a sadistic crazy person becoming gradually more obsessed with wildfire, and is prepared to commit fiery genocide on her own people, like Aerys tried to. Jaime on the other hand has a redemption arc.\n* Targaryens have a famous penchant for sibling-based incest. We see this with Cersei and Jaime.\n* Jaime's aunt on Tywins side throws a remark at him about how he's not his father's son, whereas Tyrion is. This is likely just a reference to personality traits, but could also be the author hinting at a more literal truth.\n\nThe neat symmetry I mentioned:\n\n* Tywin is obsessed with status, and he hates Tyrion for being a misshapen dwarf. Dotes on his firstborn twins who are successful in the traditional gender roles of westerosi nobility - both physically beautiful, she the wife of a king, him a famous knight. It would be interesting if the only kid that was actually his was the one he just hates. Maybe the hatred is so strong because deep down he knows Tyrion is the only one that's his, and it's a reflection that he couldn't produce the qualities he desired in children.\n* Tyrion killed his father. If Aerys was Jaime's father, then so did Jaime. He's not just the kingslayer, he's a kinslayer too.\n* Cersei might fulfill her father's crazed plan to purge king's landing in wildfire, and Jaime might have to repeat history and kill the regent once more, to save everyone like he did before, also fulfilling the valonquar prophecy, since he's technically her little brother, as she came out first of the twins.\n* Joffrey would actually have been the rightful heir to the throne, so Ned needn't have bothered to try to stop it, which lead to the war and all of it. Cerseis kids also seem to follow that Targaryen \"insane sadist / good boi\" coin flip idea.\n* It echoes the blackfyre rebellion where Targaryen bastards clashed against the trueborn Targaryens for the throne, if Daenerys fights Cersei.

{"article": "Lily Potter was charmed into loving James Potter by some or all of the Marauders. Lily is described as being a kind intelligent girl from a muggle home who befriends young Snape. In fifth year it is made clear that James has a crush on her that she does not reciprocate. She calls him a toerag, addresses him only by his last name and despises him for being a bully. Soon afterward he continues to actually abuse her childhood friend and she stands up to the Marauders. Snape calls her a mudblood which upset her allegedly ending their friendship. However this makes no sense. Snape is himself half blood. Lily knows this as well as of his poor family in the muggle world. The typical response to being angry at a friend isn't to begin dating his tormentor even if you don't want to be friends. The Marauders had already tried to actually kill Snape by putting him in contact with a werewolf. This bullying continued even later into their hogwarts years. Both James and Sirius were both from pure blood families and had extensive means and a demonstrated willingness to do such things. At no point does anyone. Not Sirius, Remus, Dumbledore, Slughorn or anyone else who personally knew Lily Potter ever tell Harry a story about how his parents fell in love or a story involving them being in love.

If so, then what about being forced to eat an onion while on a date? Clearly that's worse than having an opossum in your mouth but does that make eating onions off-limits for everyone else? \n\nSo you are asking about the worst physical thing to have in your mouth when sneezing. In order for me to answer this question, I first need to define a few terms: \n\nSneezing is an involuntary reflex. Sneezes are brought about by the irritation of a group of nasal hairs known as cilia, which line your nose and throat. These cilia contain sensory cells called 'cilia,' which detect foreign substances entering your body when you inhale.\n\nUp to a point, if you have something in your mouth when sneezing it is likely to go down the back of your throat or even into your stomach. As such, it would not be very effective for us to define 'worst' as being that which can cause death.\n\nInstead, the worst thing to have in your mouth when sneezing is that which will cause you the most physical discomfort.\n\nMy first response to this question is that the worst thing to have in your mouth when sneezing would be a piece of cloth or some other material with which you are not familiar. If you were unfamiliar with such an object, then it could cause physical discomfort as well as choking and/or suffocation", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 185, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "In general, I think that the human world can end suddenly or gradually. When considering sudden ways of ending, examples include a godlike being entering this universe and destroying it all in one act; a dangerous artificial intelligence taking over the planet within seconds; a catastrophic event occurring such as an asteroid collision with Earth which results in the extinction of life on Earth and potentially many other planets in the solar system including Mars and Mercury (but not Venus because it has no atmosphere).\n\nHowever, those ways of ending are rather unlikely. I think a more likely way in which the human world can end is gradually. There are two main ways that it could do so: (1) through nuclear war or (2) through the death of most humans. Regarding nuclear war, there have been many close calls in history and it's likely that we will see at least one such event before long.\n\nRegarding the death of most humans, this is a more likely outcome than nuclear war. In order for this to occur, there must be some mechanism that kills off most humans and preserves humanity as we know it. One way in which this could happen would be if all new people were robots (through genetic engineering or artificial intelligence) while the original human species slowly died out.\n\nAnother possibility would be if the human race were to become extinct and then aliens came in and took over (i.e., they found us before we wiped ourselves out or died naturally). However, I don't think that this is very likely because it is philosophically unintelligible. That is, it's unclear how such a scenario could even occur.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned ways in which humans could end, there are other possibilities such as being wiped out by an artificial intelligence or a godlike being. However, I think that these scenarios are even less likely than nuclear war due to their extreme unlikelihood.\nIn conclusion, it is possible that the world (i.e., humanity and Earth) could end suddenly or gradually.

There are many details to this story of course, but the main plotline is that there was a point when my life was fairly uneventful and even somewhat boring. Seemingly out of nowhere I started to think about philosophy. It's hard for me to remember what exactly led up to it because it seems so natural now, like something which has been part of me all along instead of an epiphany or sudden realization.\n\nI now feel very fortunate to be involved in philosophy and all of the interesting issues that it involves. I have always loved thinking about deep philosophical questions, but never thought that I would get much opportunity to do so; however, here I am analyzing arguments from some of the most fascinating thinkers throughout history. Although there are times when it is difficult for me (mainly due to my own shortcomings), mostly these thoughts come easily.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of my life as a philosopher is that I am constantly being challenged. For instance, whenever I read an argument, I try to figure out whether it's good or not. That requires me to think about the argument in detail and figure out exactly what its premises and conclusions are (and even whether there actually are any arguments at all). In this way I'm always thinking hard, trying to come up with new insights into deep philosophical questions.\n\nPhilosophy is also an important part of my personal life. It helps me to understand myself and those around me, which gives me a more complete picture of the world. For instance, I know that many people think that there are different schools of thought in philosophy (such as utilitarianism or existentialism), but I think this shows a lack of insight into what it really means to be a philosopher.\n\nThe real question that I am not asking here is 'What is the most interesting story of yours?' There are many different kinds of stories, but my life as a philosopher (and human) has shown me that if you want to be happy and have a good life, then one of the most essential things you need to do is find out what kind of story you're living. As part of this process it's important to reflect on your own values. What would be good for someone like yourself? By thinking about these questions in detail, I've been able to figure out what makes me tick.\n\nIn short, I'm very happy to be a philosopher.

In this movie, Kilgore is played by Robert Duvall. He utters this line after finishing up a rather successful helicopter mission which dropped napalm on Vietcong troops.\n\nNapalm is a flammable gel made from petrol and polystyrene. It was first used by the US military in World War II, where it proved useful for starting fires, as well as burning people alive.\nTo understand the reason why Kilgore likes it, we must look at his character. In 'Apocalypse Now', Kilgore is a man who has been sent to Vietnam by Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) on an operation known as Operation Phoenix. The purpose of this mission is to clear out all Vietcong troops along a riverbank.\n\nThe helicopter mission which Kilgore leads appears to be a success. All the Vietcong troops in sight have been killed, and many are floating down the river as they slowly burn away.\nWhat is the reason for Kilgore liking this smell? I believe that it is because he has a sadistic personality. He enjoys killing people, either by burning them alive or shooting them with machine guns. While some may not like his actions, others (such as myself) find him to be an interesting character.\n\nDespite the fact that Kilgore is a sadist, I believe that he does have redeeming qualities.

{"article": "First of all, it is clear that the egg must have been created first. The creation of an egg requires a chicken, and therefore the chicken cannot exist without something to create it. Since nothing can be created from nothing there must be some pre-existing thing which exists before both chickens and eggs. This 'thing' cannot simply disappear after its work is done (the creation of an egg) since other things would not then come into existence (chickens). Therefore this 'thing' must continue to exist beyond the production of eggs.\n\nSo we arrive at the conclusion that there was most likely an egg, and therefore a chicken, prior to the beginning of time. This brings up some interesting problems in physics because it would mean that events occurred before time began since they were caused by something which existed before both eggs and chickens (and possibly events). Therefore a cause must have preceded its effects.\n\nThe need for a cause prior to the beginning of time also brings up some interesting questions in philosophy. Could it be possible that there is something which preceded existence? Something that was not itself caused by another thing and therefore stood alone outside the boundaries of time, space and causation? If this were true we could say with certainty that such a thing cannot exist within our universe since whatever exists must fit into one of these categories. Because if it did not then everything would have already started to exist at once (all possible things) or nothing would ever come into existence (nothingness). It is impossible for anything to stand outside this boundary.\n\nBut if it was a chicken that came first then this presents problems of its own. If we say with certainty that existence must have been caused by something else (the pre-existing egg) then we cannot help but wonder how the chicken could come into being on its own. It seems to defy the laws of physics and logic for an event to occur without a preceding cause, yet in order for eggs and chickens to exist there must be some event which occurs without any prior causation.\n\nWe arrive once again at the same conclusion. There must have been something which existed prior to both chickens and eggs, and that thing could not have been caused by anything else or it would become the egg (which already exists). This means there is a 'thing' which stands outside of existence yet has brought it into being.\n\nThis brings us back to the question 'what is this thing?'

{"article": "The glass is half full. What makes it empty or full? It is a paradigm, which cannot be held in the hand. That which we call \"half-full\" and \"half-empty\" are only relative to some quantity of fluid contained therein, yet they have no absolute reality that can be measured like one would measure out a liter of water at sea level with an accurate device; rather these phrases are used as simple heuristics for understanding whether one's cup runneth over or not.\n\nThere are many other ways to look at this question, and it is interesting because its answer depends on the definition of \"half-full\" and \"half-empty\", which itself shifts perspective. However, I think there is a more fundamental issue with this paradigm than just whether it's half full or not.\n\nThe glass is half full. Why does it matter what the glass contains? The water cannot be contained in anything else unless it is poured out, so we can't measure its volume or weight; rather its \"quantity\" is a function of the space that it occupies. Therefore if I were to fill this cup with half a liter of liquid and you were to pour some down an alleyway for rats to drink, then your act would not affect the quantity of fluid within my cup.\nThere is another way to view this paradigm, which I call the \"inertia paradigm\". This will illuminate further why the contents of the glass are irrelevant. Imagine that you were in a very high-speed train going eastward. You had a full cup of water and an empty cup of water, both with lids on them. Then suddenly your train derails and hits another speeding train coming from the west at full speed, so that they collide head-on.\nThe inertia paradigm says that the moving train would leave its track and continue eastward, pushing all objects in front of it with equal force. So if you were to pour out water while on this train, it would continue to move forward without any effect from the water's weight. If you had a glass full of earth or sand instead of water, then by pouring some out onto the floor it would weigh down less than a half-empty glass because there is now more air inside.\n\nSo the \"half-full\" and \"half-empty\" paradigm is based on a single axis of comparison: volume. But there are two other axes to consider, one is mass (weight) and the other is density.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 204, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "The most obvious things are the ones that affect our everyday life, however there are some that do not require much effort. First of all is to have a posture correct for your body type and secondly, having a good sleeping habit.\n\nThe first one will allow you to be comfortable in standing position as well as sitting or lying down position. In order to achieve this we need something like an adjustable chair with armrests which can support our neck and head while being seated with it's back at ~90 degrees angle from the floor (according to my experience), or sit on something like Yoga ball/balance cushion/exercise ball where you naturally lean backward because of its shape but still keep your chin up so your neck muscles don't get strained too much; this way we also avoid hunching forward too far which puts unnecessary strain on shoulders resulting in rounded shoulder posture.\nThe second part is more important which will help us prevent some of the most common diseases and have a better posture. It is very simple really, all we need to do it get enough sleep every day. This can be achieved by waking up at about the same time every day (ideally before sunrise) and going to sleep in good time before sunset. Of course if you go to bed late because you had fun or whatever but feel sleepy in the morning then I would advice keeping your house lights dimmed so they don't affect your circadian rhythm too much.\n\nAnother way to achieve this is by creating light-dark cycle with your daily activities (I am still experimenting with it myself), for example go out into the sun in the morning, then do some physical activity and work/study in the afternoon. Then when evening comes spend time with your family while watching TV or playing board games about an hour before going to sleep.\n\nBy doing this we help our body to naturally produce melatonin which is a neurotransmitter that prepares the body for sleeping, also it's heavily involved in regulating circadian rhythm. It is produced when there is little light and decreases when there's more or no light.\n\nI hope this helps you with your problem, I would also recommend getting some exercise and stretching as well as a healthy diet. The rest depends on what kind of posture is the most problematic for you.\n\nFor example if you have a problem with rounded shoulders then I would advise to do some exercises that strengthen your back and shoulder muscles such as pull-ups or backward rows.

{"article": "I’m just gonna paste the comment I wrote yesterday when someone asked this same question. It’s a novel, but only because it includes specific examples pulled from my experience being emotionally cheated on. I’m not going to include a tl;dr for it because every tome anyone has ever tried to sum it up in a sentence or two, the comment immediately garners criticism of the “whataboutism” variety.\n\n——\n\n\nEmotional cheating usually starts out as an innocent friendship between two coworkers at work. A lot of times what happens is, whether it is verbally acknowledged or not, one or both of the participants of the friendship are or become attracted to the other both physically and intellectually. When this happens, it poses a serious risk for their relationship(s) at home.\n\nRelationships wane, they go through rough patches where communication could certainly be better. And sometimes people are just victims of circumstance, like a couple who lives together but works totally opposite shifts and don’t even get to have the same days off together. In essence, really the only time they get to see each other is for at most an hour or two a day, which is typically spent going over the need-to-do lists that you’d expect from a cohabitating partnership (feed the dog, mow the lawn, grab the mail, ‘did you call your mom about that thing?’, we need to get this leak fixed, etc.)\n\nIt has literally been proven that proximity breeds a sense of likability and attachment. And in the scenario I just laid out above, proximity to a cute coworker who gives you 30+ minutes of uninterrupted attention every single day during your shared work lunches can literally spell the end of a relationship if people aren’t careful.\n\nAdd to that if you and your partner aren’t quite seeing eye to eye but are too busy with work and hardly ever see each other to have the time to make any real progress on the issue... yeah, people latch onto that cute guy or gal at work pretty easily and it happens way more than people think.\n\nThey exchange phone numbers and the person with the crush tells themselves they haven’t done anything wrong by getting their coworker’s number. “We’re just friends; coworkers get other coworker’s numbers all the time.”\n\nThey start chatting every night or every other night, and for hours. There isn’t anything inappropriate in the messages, however it does actually begin to cut into the very little overlap of time they have to share with their partner. Even worse is when they choose to omit any mention about that one specific coworker from the conversation with their partner when s/he asks them about their day.\n\nIf left unchecked, this type of behavior has the potential to create such emotional distance between the partners in the primary relationship that the partner who is preoccupied with chasing their coworker crush can end up losing most if not all of their emotional attachment to their partner.\n\nAnd when their partner finds out about his or her new friend, the preoccupied partner more often than not will deny and downplay the connection they have with their coworker, because they know they haven’t technically done anything wrong. They gaslight their partner even as they continue to grow closer to the friend at work. This of course drives a wedge between the two partners and creates a world of hurt for their partner whose feelings have been invalidated... it’s just a gotdamn mess and it’s shitty to do to someone.\n\nAnyway, I’ll end the novel there.

{"article": "Emotional cheating would be the one I would most accept. It is a difficult thing to understand because what constitutes emotional cheating is not set in stone, and people's interpretations of it vary widely. A common conception of emotional cheating is that someone has an ongoing relationship with another partner while also having a sexual/romantic relationship with you.\n\nI think it's not a good idea to restrict what people can and cannot do. If they wish to have multiple relationships, then it is up to them? I would never support or encourage cheating because I wouldn't want someone who has cheated on me. But if the other person doesn't mind my partner having other partners, then why should I?\n\nThe main problem with emotional cheating is that it has the potential to destroy what you have, when physical cheating does not. Physical cheating might be more likely to lead to diseases being spread and so on, but at least then one could argue that one would still have something after it was over, even if damaged.\nPhysical cheating is more direct. It's more noticeable and uncomfortable to deal with. However, the pain caused by physical cheating isn't anything that can't be overcome, if there is true love between two people.\n\nThat said, if my partner were to physically cheat with someone else, they would lose a great deal of my respect. I wouldn't expect them to be able to continue our relationship after that (unless the other person was also in a relationship). Emotional cheating is different because it's usually less obvious and harder to detect.\nEmotional cheating is often more harmful than physical cheating because it can lead to the destruction of love, trust and everything else that might have existed between people.

The thing to remember here is that there are certain chemicals in our bodies (called neurotransmitters) that help regulate things like moods and energy levels.\n\nSo if you drink coffee (or tea) then your body will absorb the caffeine in it and that caffeine will make its way to your brain. The neurotransmitters in our brains react to this chemical by increasing their activity levels, which can be helpful for increasing energy or motivation.\n\nHowever, this effect usually wears off quickly and the body will eventually try to compensate by producing even more neurotransmitters.

When Tangled came out, people didn't have the faith in Disney that they once did.

{"article": "Yes, and no. Yes, it is often not simply gluten but a variety of confounding factors. There are many conditions that a standard fare gluten rich diet may trigger and all the changes that people go through on elimination diets introduce more confounding factors. But also no, non-celiac gluten sensitive is absolutely a thing; it's actually a whole host of different things that we understand with various levels of confidence.\n\nThe fact is it's complicated. Yes, for some people it is a fad, for others, as you mentioned, it is just some other ingredient commonly found in the same foods that they're eliminating, but the number of Americans dealing with this in the last decade or so is statistically significant even beyond those confounding factors.\n\nAt the end of the day, its frankly nobody else's business to dictate other people's dietary restrictions. If you're a doctor or nutritionist helping a patient, by all means give recommendations based on your knowledge and expertise, but if you're just another lay person convinced that people are just making it up or aren't *really* gluten sensitive, kindly shove off.\n\nIf someone orders a gluten free bun (that you offer anyway) for their burger while drinking a beer and not worrying about the fries that shared oil with the chicken tenders, just serve them the fucking bun they order. It's none of your business whether or not it's \"real\". The insane extent that people worry about what other people choose to eat or not eat is mindboggling.

{"article": "This is incorrect. It's definitely been a fad, but I don't have celiac and I've been functionally gluten-free for a decade. I do this because my behavior and thinking ability is markedly different on gluten versus off gluten. \n\nGluten sensitivity is a real thing, separate from celiac. To say that nutritional deficiencies could result sounds worse than it is. \n\nThe truth is that gluten-containing foods are often supplemented with vitamins during processing. If you're not eating the bread with mandated levels of vitamins, you'll have to get them yourself in tablet form if you need them. Gluten itself is not especially nutritious, it's just that the things it's in have added vitamins that you might need to replace.\n\nThe big drawbacks are:\n\n- everyone makes fun of you for buying into a fad, even when you were doing it for years before it was a fad.\n\n- it's expensive af to maintain that diet\n\n- it's hard to find places with things you can eat.

You experienced the demonic supernatural.\n\nThe proof is all around us.\n\nEvery other religion starts with a lone revelation, normally by a single man, and they spread their religion with money, power, and societal pressure. Only Christ changed the world by laying down money and power while fighting against societal pressure.\n\nSo the Jews prophesied a messiah was coming, right?\n\nIsaiah 53\n\n&gt;5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.\n\nThey had said thousands of years ago a man was going to show up and turn the world on it's head. Well here comes this guy performing miracles claiming to be the Messiah. He's fulfilling prophecies left and right, and he's captured the hearts of the people to the point that even the rulers are afraid of doing away with him. There is no way for a man to gather that much support out of nothing. He must have been doing and saying incredible things to have garnered the love, attention, and belief of so many. The Bible even talks about where the Jewish leaders say, \"We've dealt with false prophets before. They always fade away without the true mandate of God. Let this burn out.\"\n\nActs 5\n\n&gt;34 Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space; 35 And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men. 36 For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought. 37 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed. 38 And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought: 39 But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God. 40 And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.\n\nBut that didn't happen. Jesus had so much success that it proved God was on His side. Notice here the Jews aren't saying, \"They made it all up!\" This was a public ministry. The public had seen the miracles themselves. The Jews were accusing Jesus of doing demon-magic. They were not accusing Him of lying about doing miracles.\n\nNot only this but after Jesus was crucified people claimed to see him rise from the dead. And not just a few people, but hundreds. The people that witnessed the events of Jesus were so convinced of his message and power they were willing to stand up in the face of persecution. A great many people lost their lives because they refused to recant their words. They believed that Jesus was Lord. These people forfeited their lives because they were there. They had seen Jesus perform miracles. They heard his words. They knew the truth, and they could not face their deaths and lie to save their own skins. This must have been a very powerful message indeed.\n\nThe message continued to survive persecution even with the power of the world's greatest empire trying to snuff them out. These Christians, these poor middle eastern men and women, were surviving against armies, gold, and might with simply the power of the words of Jesus on their hearts. Ultimately they did survive completely, and the message of Jesus spread like wildfire, changing the world over in a figurative blink of an eye. Not a single person living today has had their life unaffected by the words and actions of this singular poor man from the middle east.

What I mean by this is that if for example, you were to ask 'Is there life outside of Earth' and I was god (or even just an all-knowing being), then my answer would only hold true in relation to your current understanding of science, space exploration etc. If you asked me instead 'Does life exist beyond our solar system?' then my answer might very well change depending on whether or not we had evidence yet as scientists about the existence of extraterrestrial life (as well as other factors). Similarly, if I were to tell you right now ''Yes', but with the caveat that there are some unknown variables at play which may alter this fact in future, how much confidence do you have in my response? Would your belief change much?\nBecause the question has no contextual value, it really is a loaded question.

The best we can hope for is the absence of bad parents, and neither are these necessarily strict.\n\nAlright, now I will go into detail on the different types of parenting. The first category to consider is what I call 'the opposite extreme'. This consists of parents who are too strict; those who feel that their child should be doing as they say. They tend to override any attempt from their kids to show independence or take charge, and instead treat them as if they were still a baby. It seems like you were talking about these kind of parents when you said \"I am not saying don't set rules for your children....\n\nThe second type of parents I call 'the good guy'. These are the ones who have a set of rules, and stick to them. They make sure their kids know what they can and cannot do, but at the same time give them enough freedom to be able to have fun on their own. In some cases these parents may even go so far as not setting any rules at all; however this is very rare because usually in that case the child gets into more trouble than if there were any rules.\n\nThe third type of parents are what I call 'the bad guy'. These are the ones who do not set rules, and only care about themselves. They tend to use their kids as an emotional outlet for problems they have in their lives; whether it be financial or something else. Typically these people will get angry easily at things that would be considered trivial by others because they don't feel like dealing with it on their own.\nNow I can move on to the second part of your question. What do you consider a strict parent? Well, first let me explain what makes a person strict; someone who won't bend for anything or anyone. They tend to stick with their decisions no matter how much others beg them, and usually feel like they have everything under control.\n\nNow then, what do you consider a strict parent? From what I can tell it seems that one of the most common traits of these parents is their unwillingness to show any weakness in front of their kids. They want to be seen as infallible and perfect; an image that they feel can only be attained if they don't allow for mistakes or weaknesses on their part.

I believe meditation in its simplest form was about escaping the stress of life by sitting still and doing nothing, which sounds quite nice.\nSelf-control and wholesome behaviour are also two words that do not go together, at least in the human world.

The same applies for Monday and Friday, while Tuesday and Thursday could be confused with each other.\nHowever, I would say that the numbering of days on a calendar is still not very clearly defined. For example, we could call Saturday 'the eighth day' and Sunday 'the first day', since it's the last of the week.

{"article": "Okay, so the first thing to think about when giving a gift is what kind of social environment you are giving it in. Specifically, if this couple lives alone or have friends and family over often. Also consider their income status and how much they will appreciate a large financial expense (I would recommend against buying them an expensive home if they live alone with no significant other). From there you can learn more about their personality type from any information that they may offer up themselves (they could say something like \"we work hard but we play hard too\" or \"we enjoy our time at home together\"), which could influence your decision on whether to buy them furniture, art or electronics.\nAlso, you should remember that the gift is a reflection of yourself. So even if they aren't currently in need of something, it could be good to give them something that will help them with their life in some way or another (like art supplies). You can also give a more practical gift like electronics so long as there is no ulterior motive at work: buying someone an expensive TV when they have said nothing about wanting one might come across as trying to bribe them into liking you.\n\nNow let's say you are buying for a couple who have friends and family over often. Here I would recommend getting them some sort of home entertainment system, perhaps an outdoor grill or small appliances (though if they live in the Midwest I would not recommend a grill since it will probably get stolen). You could also buy them furniture depending on how much their place is furnished; however, make sure that whatever you buy fits with their decorating scheme.\n\nFinally, if you are buying for a couple who live alone with no family or friends nearby I would recommend getting them some sort of home appliance that they will likely use often. Several appliances worth considering include refrigerators (if theirs is old), dishwashers, coffee machines and microwaves.\n\nIn conclusion, when thinking about what is a great housewarming gift for a couple in their 30's buying their first home you should consider the social environment that they will be receiving it in, how much money they have to spend, and what kind of personality they have.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 305, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

On one hand, it is entirely possible to change history by inserting a rubber duck into it at any point. However, this would not be desirable since there are many things that you can't control as well as unknown consequences.\n\nOn one hand, if you insert a rubber duck into history at the point just before WWII began, it could have stopped Hitler from coming to power. This might have changed many things in world history. However there would be no guarantee that all the events leading up to WWII would not occur again. In fact they may even repeat themselves on another continent.\n\nIn addition, there may be unforeseen consequences. It is possible that if you remove Hitler from power then someone even worse takes his place.\n\nOn the other hand, there are times when you must create history. For example, if you were to insert a rubber duck into the historical moment right before George Washington took office as president of the United States it is possible that he could be persuaded not to take office or to change his mind about leading America during its fight for independence from Great Britain.\n\nPerhaps you would insert a rubber duck into the historical moment right before Adolf Hitler was born. This could have prevented him from coming into power and starting WWII, which may have averted the deaths of many people in Europe and Asia.\n\nHowever, there is no guarantee that the Holocaust would not have occurred.

{"article": "I think that the impact of climate change on earthquakes is not as significant as many people believe. The Earth's temperature has increased by almost 2°C in just a century, and so I am inclined to conclude that there will be no increase at all. There are more important factors when it comes to earthquakes.\n\nThe Earth's crust is broken into plates, which are always moving. They move because of the heat and pressure inside the planet. The molten rock inside moves and stretches the tectonic plates against each other.\n\nThe plates on the surface rub against each other and one plate may slip under the other. This sudden movement creates a loud sound called an earthquake.\nThe plates can break, and this is what causes tsunamis. Tsunamis are caused when one plate slips under the other. The water in the ocean moves with the plate.\n\nThere are also other factors that may cause an earthquake. For example, if magma rises from the centre of the planet, then it can come in contact with rocks near the surface and cause a big jolt.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 329, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": "The extent to which earthquakes could or would be influenced by climate change largely depend on the degree to which connections between earthquakes and surface processes (that are modified by climate change) exist and the strength / nature of these connections. That is to say, climate change has no real capacity to change the rates at which faults accumulate strain (isostatic responses to loss of ice mass might be an exception to this, see below), but there are pathways by which various surface processes (which are influenced by climate change) can influence the exact timing of earthquakes. As elaborated on in more detail below, this means that changes in the frequency or intensity are unlikely (or at least hard to demonstrate), but changes in the degree of temporal clustering are possible (i.e. earthquakes of the magnitude that were going to happen anyway, might happen at a slightly different time because of forcing by surface processes in turn influenced by climate change).\n\nProbably the most direct example are large storm events (e.g. typhoons/hurricanes) as these can potentially \"cause\" earthquakes in actively deforming regions. Specifically, it's been argued that the reduction in atmospheric pressure can reduce normal stress on a fault sufficiently for a 'slow slip' event to occur (e.g. [Liu et al, 2009](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08042)) and similarly, reduction in normal stress from extreme amounts of erosion that occurs during typhoons can cause a seismic response (e.g. [Steer et al, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67865-y)). So, in this case, the extent to which climate change increases the frequency or severity of large typhoons/hurricanes, than it's possible that earthquake statistics could change as a result (though I'm not aware of anyone formally publishing that as such specifically for typhoons/hurricanes).\n\nThe melting of glaciers and ice sheets are another clear example of a surface change induced by warming. The rapid melting of ice sheets, specifically Greenland, has dramatically increased the frequency of so-called 'glacial earthquakes', (e.g. [Ekstrom et al, 2003](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/302/5645/622.full.pdf), [Nettles &amp; Ekstrom 2010](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-earth-040809-152414), or [Veitch &amp; Nettles, 2012](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012JF002412)), which are not earthquakes generated on faults, but are still detectable as earthquakes on seismometers. The melting of the Greenland ice sheet, and the responses of the crust from the reduction in overlying mass, seem to induce some amount of seismicity (e.g. [Olivieri &amp; Spada, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1873965214000681)).\n\nThere are also potential pathways for changes in earthquake statistics driven by human responses to climate change. One example is drought. If a drought induces more removal of groundwater, then this can potentially change seimicity patterns and \"cause\" earthquakes, (e.g. [Amos et al, 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13275) or [Wetzler et al 2019](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GL083491)).\n\nThe key point for many of these (and especially the typhoon and groundwater related examples, not so much for the glacial earthquakes) is that these are changes to the statistics of earthquakes, not so much the frequency. Simply put, if without these influences, a fault was going to generate 100 earthquakes over one year (over a range of magnitudes) randomly throughout the year, the influence of things like typhoons or groundwater pumping would be temporal clustering of some of those 100 earthquakes, not more than 100 earthquakes. In detail, it gets to some nuanced arguments about the timescale over which apparent changes in frequency are real. I.e. because earthquakes generally represent strain accumulated over time frames longer than which we have detailed observations of earthquake occurrence, arguing for changes in frequency (regardless of the cause) is problematic. That has not stopped some from arguing that there may be real, climate change induced changes in earthquake frequency (e.g. [Usman 2015](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11069-016-2226-z.pdf) which argues for an increase in earthquake frequency due to melting glaciers and enhanced erosion through, you guessed it, reduced normal stress), but at least I am skeptical of these results (or at least skeptical of the idea of this representing a true increase in frequency as opposed to a geologically short duration change in rate, but that the frequency measured over long time frames would be unchanged as this would largely be dictated by the loading rate of the faults, i.e. tectonics).", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 330, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

Unrealistic. And has ruined the world.\n\nThis was a bit of a vent, but fuck me im getting sick of all this bullshit. Quit your whole personality being based around your sexuality, quit being so easily offended, quit trying to label yourself so you can feel oppressed, and most of all, quit ruining the world for everyone else around you because they don’t agree with your gay opinions. Cause for me personally, I fucking hate everything about how idolised gay people are. You’re gay. Nobody cares except you and another gay person. Please don’t take it upon yourself to label yourself into a group, and then as a group, get offended when people hate you for being gay, and basing your entire personality on being gay.\n\nThank you for reading.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 346, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

The notion of a “color” strikes me as a rather bizarre concept because there exist no concrete objects that are properly identified by such descriptions. For example, when one talks about red or blue, they are really only referring to physical light at certain wavelengths. It seems silly and pointless for humans to assign labels like these arbitrarily based on their personal experiences with certain colors yet many people act as if these labels have some sort of objective significance which they do not actually possess.\n\nThe notion of a “red” object is therefore completely meaningless because there exists no such thing. It is not like the label “car” which does have some concrete meaning since cars are real objects that can be identified by other people.\n\nI also find it interesting how humans have developed a conceptual framework for this “color” idea. They make distinctions between colors like red and blue, yet there is no real difference between these two so-called concepts/colors.\n\nThe number one fallacy of humans is their failure to realize that all objects are just collections of atoms. The same applies for colors. A “red” object is not actually red, it merely consists of a large grouping of physical atoms that reflect light in a certain wavelength.\n\nIt seems that humans are too blinded by their own narrow perspective to realize that the concepts they have constructed for themselves are not real. It is just a delusion.\n\nIf I were to be placed in a situation where someone claimed that they are red, I would not really know what to say.

{"article": "The crust is not affected by the mantle as much as you would think. The reason for this is because Earth's crust has a high specific heat capacity, meaning it takes more energy to change its temperature than most other things. This means that the mantle doesn't have to produce too many thermal waves in order to reach equilibrium with the crust.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean that the mantle can't change the temperature of Earth's crust. It all depends on how much heat it gives off and at what distance from its source. If a strong enough thermal wave were emitted from deep within the mantle, then it could cause a significant rise in temperature near where the wave was released.\n\nThis is why plates are constantly moving along mid-ocean ridges. They form where a thermal wave has released so much heat that the mantle material starts to melt, and then it flows up until the pressure becomes too low for further melting. After this point, magma can still exist in solid form as long as its temperature remains above freezing.\n\nIt is possible that the average temperature of Earth's crust can be affected by thermal waves from within the mantle. However, for it to rise significantly would require a much bigger thermal wave.\n\nIn order for a thermal wave to reach the crust it has to travel through solid rock. This is because there are no open spaces between Earth's layers. However, heating up solid rock does not affect the temperature of anything above or below itself.\n\nThe only way for a thermal wave to reach Earth's surface would be to travel through the asthenosphere. The asthenosphere is extremely weak and can therefore easily transmit heat from deep within the mantle, but it also has low density so it cannot store much heat in its solid structure.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 361, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

That is, if the flux through the mantle was to increase (which could happen if the core suddenly got much hotter) then the heat flux through the crust would also increase (after 100 thousand years) in response (the planet would then have larger thermal emissions into space).

In essence the atmosphere and tectonic plates only really act as an insulating boundary's but are not of fixed temperature of flux. A larger heat flux will result in a larger atmospheric temperature and hence larger thermal emission. So what really controls all of this is the efficiency of the transport of heat through (thermal and compositional) convection which can be parameterised by the turnover timescale. In the mantle is of the order of hundreds of thousands of years (if my memory is correct) and in the outer core its 1-2 orders of magnitude shorter.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 363, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

The atmosphere then represents a relatively thin (on the scale of the Earth) boundary layer between the solid Earth and space with heat being radiated from the solid surface to the atmosphere (and eventually space) but also with more active movements of heat through advection / convection of air (atmosphere) and water (hydrosphere/ocean) in direct contact with the solid Earth, with this heat also eventually being radiated to space by the atmosphere. \n\nThe details of how efficient heat is moved through a planet (which is mostly a function of the presence or absence of large scale, active lid plate tectonics) and the details of the atmosphere (e.g. Venus an example of  rocky planet with a much warmer solid surface, largely driven by the way the Venusian atmosphere works in comparison to Earth) will modify the details of the thermal profiles, but ultimately, space represents the final boundary control on heat transfer out of a planet.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 364, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

I think that most people when asked this question will say they want someone who shares their values, has similar interests, and perhaps looks good on paper--someone with a good job and the same hobbies etc. But if you really ask yourself why it matters so much how these things align between you two, then my guess is that what you want most of all from your relationship partner is someone who can make life feel worth living.\n\nSo you need to ask, how can you make life feel worth living? How do you find meaning in your life and happiness with yourself? I would say that finding a way to be happy with oneself is the key to making life feel meaningful.\n\nThe second thing you could do is to focus on your own happiness. How can you be happy with yourself? A lot of people think that it's simply a matter of changing their external circumstances, but I don't believe this is the case.\n\nFor example, you could move to a new city and try to find a job there. You could improve your appearance by working out and getting plastic surgery if needed. But ultimately none of these things will make you happy or feel fulfilled in life.\n\nThe third thing you could do to find a good relationship partner is to become the type of person who would be a good match for your ideal relationship.

It is one thing to have information and be able to present it clearly, but I think a good professor should know how their students feel when they receive the information. A professor who sees this has a better chance of teaching effectively.\nI mean, let's be honest. When a student gets a bad grade on something they really struggled with, often the first thing that comes to mind is not \"how can I help this person improve their understanding of this concept.\" If anything it is more likely to be \"I wonder if there are any other jobs available in the field for me\" or even perhaps some more negative thoughts about the professor and higher education in general. Maybe it isn't even so much as thinking about how they could do better next time; maybe it's just feeling discouraged at having wasted so much time on something where there was no hope of success from the start.\n\nPeople are generally averse to failure and when one encounters that sort of situation, it's natural for them to want to avoid the source of that failure. For many students who see their grades slip at university or college, if they feel like they have no control over the material and/or their professor doesn't understand them personally as a student then they will become disheartened.\nI think a lot of teachers are aware that this happens, but I don't think they realize how much it affects the learning environment. I also suspect that students feel discouraged from even approaching teachers with questions for fear of being made to look foolish in front of their peers.\n\nI think this is a problem that stems from two sources. The first and most obvious source is the lack of empathy in some people; they are more interested in their own success than others.\nThe other source of the problem is more subtle and comes from the fact that many people feel like they have no control over their education. They are just along for the ride, as it were, hoping to make it through with a decent job afterwards.

For example, some polls are associated with a range of questions asking about policy preferences or party affiliation and others may comprise only one question on voting intention for influencing an election.\n\nIn either case, it would appear that some conception of the political climate is implicated. However, in a very general sense we are also interested in what people think about politics generally and perhaps this broader notion of climate can be used to inform us.\n\nIn this case, people's views on the country are likely to be relevant in deciding how to define political climate. For example, if most people think that there is too much politics (in a broad sense) going on right now then this might provide some indication of their perspective on what the future holds.\n\nSo, the point here is that changing opinions and perceptions are relevant to thinking about political climate. But perhaps we can also consider more immediate changes in circumstances as well.\n\nFor example, an increase in partisan rancour and conflict would be a relevant factor to bear in mind when considering political climate. If, for instance, there was a significant change in the way that politicians interacted or even if some prominent politician decided to leave public life then this might also provide us with some information about what we should expect.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 380, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "There is no excuse to be made for the corporate tax flat and not progressive like personal tax. It's a failed system that has created societal injustice and economic inequality. The problem is twofold: first, US corporations are taxed at 35% by the federal government, which when combined with state taxes can reach up to almost 60%. This makes it difficult for new businesses to compete in global markets as they have higher operating costs than their international counterparts; this includes startups.\n\nThe second big issue from an economic perspective is that capital gains (profits) are treated differently from labor income (wages). Capital gains are taxed at 15%, whereas your wages or salary get hit with a top rate of about 40%. The reason for this difference? Because during the Reagan era, conservative economists wanted more investment into research and development... but what happened instead was that most of these companies used all their available cash flow on share buybacks... rather than investing in R&amp;D.\n\nIn fact, if you look at the Google search trends for 'buybacks' and 'R&amp;D', you will see that there is almost no correlation between these two concepts. What we have instead is an economic system where workers are taxed more than corporations, which only serves to perpetuate income inequality in this country.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons for this is that workers are not represented in corporate boardrooms, which is also part of the problem. We already have a system where corporations control governments through campaign contributions and lobbying, but when you add in the fact that they can put their own people on company boards... it becomes even worse.\n\nIf you look at the history of US companies, it's not a stretch to say that most of them started as small businesses. Many were created by entrepreneurs working out of their garage or basement. Over time, these startups grew into multi-billion dollar behemoths through hard work and ingenuity.\n\nBut nowadays it's almost impossible to start a new business because many of the markets are already dominated by big corporations. The reason is that these companies can afford to buy up potential competitors and stifle innovation in the marketplace.\n\nWhat we have instead is a market place that is less competitive in the long run, which results in higher prices for consumers and fewer new business opportunities. This has caused massive wealth inequality between large corporations and small businesses...", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 382, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "My first thoughts on this topic are that it is a very tricky question, and the answer is not so simple. Are you asking me about people who do not want vaccinations for their children and who actively try to dissuade other parents from vaccinating their children, or are you talking about people who have questions regarding vaccines? It's important to clarify your definition of anti-vax because many people would argue that even though they may be skeptical of vaccines, they still believe in them but choose to abstain from vaccination because of personal reasons or religious beliefs.\n\nI am going to begin my response with some background information on what vaccines actually are. Vaccines contain weakened forms of viruses which can cause diseases such as smallpox, polio and measles amongst others. The goal behind giving these vaccinations is essentially preventative health care; however there is also an element in play known as herd immunity wherein if a large enough percentage (usually around 85%) within a population has been vaccinated against certain diseases then those diseases will no longer exist within the population due to lack of contact between unvaccinated individuals and infected individuals spreading disease.\n\nI first want to address the issue of herd immunity. The idea behind herd immunity is that when a large percentage within a population has been vaccinated then it creates an invisible wall which prevents transmission of disease, and this can be achieved through vaccination alone as long as enough individuals have been vaccinated. Even though vaccine-preventable diseases may still exist within the population, they are not able to spread very easily because those who are susceptible do not come into contact with them and so become protected from becoming infected themselves.\n\nIn order for herd immunity to be effective it's important that a large enough percentage within the population is vaccinated, which would then mean that there are no unvaccinated individuals left in contact with those who have become infected. This means that even if someone comes into contact with an individual who has contracted a disease then they will not themselves become infected because all of the susceptible individuals would already have been vaccinated and therefore cannot pass on the disease to other people.\n\nHerd immunity only works when the entire population is vaccinated, but it doesn't have to be 100% of the population. The percentage required for herd immunity varies from disease to disease and even depends on the region in which you are living; however a common consensus seems to be that around 85% vaccination within a particular area will effectively prevent transmission of diseases. According to an article published by WHO (World Health Organization) in 2005 \"While long-lasting protection against poliomyelitis is attainable through routine immunization, eradication can only occur as a result of deliberate efforts at all levels based on sound public health principles and supported by strong political commitment.\" This shows us that while it may not be possible achieve complete eradication with vaccines alone there is still significant benefit in vaccinating large portions of the population.\n\nThe argument for vaccinating 100% of a population is based on the idea that as soon as there are even just one or two unvaccinated individuals then someone who has been infected with disease can still become contagious to others, and therefore making vaccination compulsory would prevent this from happening. However when it comes down to whether or not vaccines should be mandatory I think it's important to consider what is actually being done by those who choose not to vaccinate their children. Is it right for us to force them into doing something which they have doubts about? Are we infringing upon their human rights?\n\nI can see both sides of the issue; however in my opinion public health officials should always strive towards protecting the most people possible, and so if there are parents out there who will refuse vaccination because they believe that vaccinations cause autism then perhaps rather than forcing them into getting vaccinated you could try and encourage them through education on why vaccines do not cause autism.\n\nFrom a utilitarian point of view I believe that it's important to consider how your actions will affect others, and as mentioned earlier in my response herd immunity is dependent on the level of vaccination within a particular population. However if you refuse to vaccinate your child then they are no longer receiving the protection which herd immunity can offer because their unvaccinated status makes them susceptible to infection from those who have been vaccinated.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 386, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "There is a reason that we are all born with the ability to be biased, it is because without bias and prejudice, there cannot be any form of decision making.\n\nThe human brain works as a processor. At birth, humans are like empty hard drives that need information filled into them in order for them to work properly and become fully functional. When you enter this world you start off with a mind which has no pre-existing knowledge or information in it yet; however, your parents teach you how things should appear to you by giving you their own beliefs about the world around us and what they think about various topics such as politics and religion etc… from day one until when we are old enough at school where our teachers tell us what they believe.\n\nLet's take an example of a baby boy born into the world, he is completely neutral and unbiased because at this stage his mind has no pre-existing knowledge or beliefs about anything nor does it have any biases. However, as time goes on for months and years the boy hears from people around him such as his parents who tell him which religion to follow and what they believe in etc…\n\nThe human brain works by filtering out information that we don't need so that our brains do not become overloaded with too much information to process all at once. The baby can only take in so much information at one time until its mind will automatically filter out unimportant data.\nFor example, if you were to sit in a room full of people and they all started talking at once, your brain would automatically filter out the unimportant data such as the noise from people's voices; instead it will focus on what is being said. This way of thinking has allowed humans to survive this far without going crazy because otherwise it would be too much information for us to process all at once.\n\nAs you grow older, your parents tell you what they believe in such as religion and politics; however, you will always keep an open mind to other possibilities. The brain does not automatically shut off this possibility but instead keeps it stored away until the individual is old enough to make their own decisions about things for themselves.\n\nWhen you are older and more independent, the brain is still able to hold onto these beliefs but will gradually start filtering out all of the unnecessary information given by other people. The less likely it becomes that we believe in something then our brain will remove that belief from its memory banks until such a time where new pertinent evidence suggests that this belief should remain stored.\n\nFor example, if a person is religious then they will believe that when we die our soul goes to heaven and lives there for eternity; however, not a lot of people actually know what happens after death. As time goes on, the brain will start to filter out this idea of an afterlife unless new information comes along which suggests that it may be true such as near death experiences and ghost sightings etc… until eventually once you grow old enough your mind will have completely removed all belief in any form of religion or other paranormal events.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 389, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

It's like a spiderweb - when you touch one area, it affects many others in subtle ways.\n\nFor example, if you take the reality of a food surplus or shortage in one region as a given (which is true) and examine the effects of that situation on human behavior, then it's easy to see why people would not want to waste food. The reason for this is because there are other humans who need it.\n\nIn a society where there is not enough food, it means that many people will die of starvation. So when you see someone wasting food, your brain interprets this as 'the person who wasted the food could have fed other humans and they did not.' In reality, this may or may not be true. But because humans are social animals, we react emotionally to the behavior of others.\n\nIn a society where there are no shortages, it is easy to waste food without giving it much thought because you can always get more. But if one of those people who wasted food had been starving, then you would find the act repulsive - even if that person was not in your own community/family/etc.\n\nIf there are no shortages, then people may not need to worry about where the food is going. So they don't care if others waste it because the issue of scarcity doesn't apply to them.\nAnother way to look at the issue is to view it from a different angle. Most people don't think about where their food comes from, or how it's produced. It just magically appears in stores and on tables, ready for consumption.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 399, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": "What is my favorite food or dish to cook? All right, let's get cooking. My favorites are definitely the dishes with garlic and/or onions in them of various kinds. I enjoy the smell of garlic on my hands after digging into a nice piece of chicken that has been slathered in rich cream sauce mixed with some diced onion strings. It seems delicious no matter what else is added to it, but if you add just a bit more cayenne pepper then it becomes even better as the hotness really cuts through all of the flavors and adds another dimension by making your taste buds tingle slightly while you chew away at this now adorned morsel of meaty goodness.\n\nMy second favorite is definitely any sort of pasta dish that has a lot of garlic in it. Whether it is white, red or green I do not care because they all taste good and each one will provide different sensations to make your mouth tingle with their unique flavor profiles. It feels so good when you bite into one of these noodles as the texture just seems to melt away at your tongue and then suddenly, the garlic kicks in and makes your taste buds wake up from their dormant state.\n\nMy third favorite is pretty self-explanatory. It's hard to beat a nice chicken breast cooked in garlic and parmesan cheese. Trust me, it really does melt in your mouth and sometimes I just cut off slices of the entire thing and eat them with some bread that has been doused in olive oil.\nNow for my least favorite food or dish to cook. I'm going to have to go with shellfish, because the smell is just too much for me. It's not that they taste bad, but when you are eating shrimp and stuff like that it just seems as if there is a layer of stench above everything else in your mouth and then even after you swallow it lingers around in your nose making you want to gag.\nShellfish have nothing on onions though, so I would say my least favorite food or dish to cook is definitely onion rings. These things are just too greasy for me and when you bite into one of them they just seem like a ball of oil that has been mixed with some onion powder.\n\nSo there you have it. My favorite foods or dishes to cook are garlic and onion based with a side of cayenne pepper, while my least favorites are shellfish followed by onion rings.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 400, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": "It is commonly held that a band's live album represents the pinnacle of their work. This is because, although it can be argued that some bands sound better in concert than they do in studio, this is usually due to production quality and not the music itself. An example of such an artist would be The Pixies, who have done both several times over (although I personally prefer their early albums recorded at Black Francis' apartment). But as we all know, these days most bands are known for being more famous for silly things like personality clashes or playing well live rather than recording well.\n\nSo when an artist puts out a live album that is better than their studio work, it's a big deal. In the case of The Pixies' concert at The Town And Country Club in 1991, they played together for what was likely going to be their last show before their eventual breakup (which finally happened in 1993). This concert was also one of the first uses of cell phones as recording devices, so there are hundreds if not thousands of records and videos from the show available online.\nNow, I'm going to get on my soapbox for a bit. Not that this is really all that opinionated of me, but in my analysis it's pretty clear to me why The Pixies' live version of Head Carrier (their last studio album) outshines their original: it's because they mean every word. Here are just two examples:\n\nThe song opens with a cell phone recording of Frank Black (the frontman) saying the words: 'Hi, welcome to The Town And Country Club. This is your band, this is who you're here for.' He then goes on to say that he's sure they could have done better in the studio and that they're not planning on coming back here any time soon. If we listen closely we can hear him chuckle as he says it.\n\nThe Pixies don't sound like they're on stage trying to entertain us for 2 hours, instead they sound like a band who doesn't want the show to end. They were probably playing their hearts out that night because it was one of their last shows and they wanted to make sure everyone knew how much fun they had performing.\n\nThe studio version is not lacking in this area, however. At the beginning of that song we hear someone say something like: 'Hi, welcome to The Town And Country Club. This is your band.' (It's hard to make it out because the crowd starts cheering right after he says it.)", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 401, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": "I know the concept of manifest destiny and I agree that it is a good idea, but it could use some work. It's too overbearing in terms of scale: when you have a nice long term plan of goals to reach for, you should clearly define what those goals are instead of essentially leaving them open ended. In my opinion this will likely lead to confusion among the members who don't understand why their actions were necessary or how they fit into the big picture.\n\nI think that a big part of the issue is that we don't have enough information to really get started. This is why I suggest defining concrete goals, as well as breaking them down into smaller steps along with time frames and criteria for when you can say they are done. For example, in your original manifesto it says 'We declare that this will be a new nation' - Where do you want it? How many people need to be there? What does the country look like at its inception? These questions should all be answered so we know exactly what needs to happen.\n\nI can see that the manifesto is written in a way to be very general, which allows for people to interpret it as they wish. But this at times leads to confusion and lack of direction. I suggest writing more clearly about what you want, but also accepting that some things will change over time if different circumstances come up. In short: make an open ended plan with clear goals and guidelines.\n\nI think this will ensure that the people who are working toward the manifest destiny aren't necessarily confused about why they're doing it, and that we can more quickly get to work instead of having debates for a long time.

This happens because there is often only one person or very few people running for office. Without a larger field to choose from, voters tend to vote for the familiar rather than take a risk on someone new.\n\nThere is also the danger that many of those elected will be people who are very successful in business.

{"article": "If a country is not sovereign, then it cannot legitimately declare its own borders. If the US border is opened to immigrants, this will mean the US government has no control over immigration into the country. The reason why sovereignty matters when it comes to immigration policy is that without sovereignty, there would be no way to prevent foreign governments from forcing their citizens, or even non-citizens within their jurisdictions from moving into and living in the United States.\n\nGiven that a country has the right to make immigration policy because of its sovereignty, it then follows that if the United States government were not able to control immigration policy, this would mean foreign governments could push their citizens into the US. This is clearly undesirable since these immigrants might have different values from Americans and potentially cause trouble within American borders.\n\nSince the US government is obviously not going to allow this, it would then follow that if the United States border were opened up with Mexico, then other countries could force their citizens into the US. This would be especially true of countries like China and India who have very large populations.\n\nIf other countries were allowed to push their citizens into the US, this would necessarily mean the United States government no longer has control over immigration policy.

The average distance between them is about 384,000 km (238,000 miles), and it takes exactly 27 1/3 days for the moon to orbit the Earth once.\n\nSo if you imagine an observer on one of these bodies in space watching its partner orbiting at a constant distance, then he would see both objects rotate once every day around their axis. That's what we call 'Tidal Locking'. It means that our hypothetical observer will never be able to see his partner as rotating around him because as soon as this happens, they'll move away from each other and won't remain in a fixed configuration anymore.\n\nSo when such a configuration is achieved it means that the two bodies will rotate around each other with exactly the same speed and in opposite directions. Now, if you were to measure how long an Earth day was on this hypothetical planet whose length of year is about 365 days, you would find out that they both are approximately 24 hours long.\n\nBut, on a tidally locked body like the Earth, there is no phenomenon of 'Eclipses' since they are rotating at the same rate as the Moon which orbits around them.\n\nSo, in a way the Earth day is longer than 24 hours since it also takes about 86 000 seconds for the Moon to orbit around it.\n\nSo the Earth day is actually about 86 000/24=3600 seconds long.\n\nNow, if you were to ask how long the Moon day is, it would be about 24*27 1/3=49 days (which is longer than our year), and in a way this means that a tidally locked body like Earth has a shorter day since its rotation around its axis takes only one-half as much time.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 420, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

Dormitories usually come with one or more roommates which is both good and bad in the long run.

Most of these capabilities come from the fact that consoles use a fixed hardware and thus can expose some very low level features of said hardware without running in compatibility problems. \n\nAnother thing is that, while the components themselves are similar to what you can get on PC, the whole system is not.

So there is no way for humans to know exactly how those work unless we were able to have microscopic vision or a microscope with high enough resolution.\n\nThere is also the fact that consoles are not made of only one kind of material. They have many different components and each \ncomponent has a certain function. So to emulate it would require an understanding for how all those parts work together in perfect harmony.\nThis is why I think that the creation of an emulator for a console cannot possibly be done by humans.

The problem tends to come in with getting the timing right to make the games actually playable.  Different processors may have similar or identical instructions, but may have different processing times for them.  Or your PC may not have suitable instructions to map to what a console processor has, and has to emulate that instruction.  If it takes (for example) four PC instructions to emulate a console instruction, then the PC needs to be at least four times faster than the console to emulate that instruction at the same speed.  At the same time, the PC may be faster at processing other instructions, so you have to artificially _slow down_ the PC instructions to try to get the timing right.\n\nThat a big part of the problem.  The next problem has to do with the fact that most consoles don't have detailed public documentation on how they function.  They have to be reverse-engineered to the best of the emulator developers ability -- and if there are special undocumented functions within the hardware, particularly ones rarely used, these may not be present in the emulator.  This can sometimes be why an otherwise successful emulator can't run a specific game properly -- it may be relying on hardware specific timings, or undocumented functionality that is infrequently used to operate.\n\nLastly, for more modern consoles there may be the issue of encryption getting in the way.  Without the encryption key, it may be that certain data formats may not be easy or possible to reverse engineer.  This wasn't an issue with early consoles, but is becoming an issue with more modern consoles.  On disc formats may be encrypted, along with hard disk filesystems, making it difficult to get at operating system internals to properly emulate whatever is going on.\n\nHTH!", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 431, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

A common example of this in the physical world would be the fact that if you and I were to have an extended conversation about something, after we stop speaking for some time there will come a point where we can't 'remember' what was said during our discussion. This happens because even though I may consciously remember speaking with you on whatever topic it may have been, my memory only allows certain things to remain in consciousness at any given time (this is referred to as \"working memory\"). As soon as new information enters into consciousness from another source or through other means, the original source eventually gets overwritten by more dominant thoughts.\n\nI'm not sure if this is what you were asking, but I think it's rather interesting to point out that 'forgetting' can actually be understood as a form of mental energy conservation.

Some would say it is programming, but I think the best way to describe it is as a glitch in evolution.\n\nWhen one animal is more fit than another (because its body is better at surviving and reproducing) it has the evolutionary advantage. The less fit animals are then selected against naturally, as they have fewer offspring.\n\nIf a glitch arises in the process, and the animal 'decides' to be altruistic or more intelligent than it needs to be, then that is also selected against. There are many such glitches; there will always be those who are weaker and can't reproduce as well because they don't have enough food etc. In nature, these animals are eaten by others.\n\nIn the case of humans, they are able to live in groups.

If animals live on the ground or in water (or some other places) they will most likely die slowly from exposure or starvation which could take days, months or years depending on what kind of animal you pick and how old they are.\n\nBut an animal that lives in the air, and especially birds, they usually die quickly from being hit by some natural or man-made danger such as a vehicle, predator attack or just old age. This means it is less painful to be reborn as them than those living on the ground for animals like cats, dogs and even human beings (if you were unfortunate enough to suffer death by starvation). In essence when being reborn again your pain will lessen greatly if you become a bird instead.\nNow there are various birds that could be considered for rebirth such as the Eagle, Falcon, Hawk or even some kinds of Parrots. I will not go into great detail on these but instead focus more on the most likely bird to die first before being reborn again which is a crow.\n\nCrows are plentiful and live on the ground but they also thrive in places where there is water. They have a wide range of food that they can eat from worms, insects, small animals or even some kinds of fruits (depending how far north you go really). But one thing to note about crows is that many do not reach old age as their life expectancy rarely reaches past 5 years.\n\nTo conclude, if you want to be reborn again as a different life form I would suggest becoming a crow first before being reborn into another animal. Reasons for this are more abundant than those of other animals and the pain from death is least painful compared to any other bird or even human beings in general.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 440, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

For me it's like being in the mob - every time I thought I was out, it dragged me back in.\nSo, my answer is how do I live with my impending death? I stopped thinking about me and thinking about others. So much of my wanting to die is because the world is a terrible, terrible place right now. People are the worst - ruining this planet and each other for money (something WE invented). Anyway, that isn't changing anytime soon - so I started doing for others what no one was doing for me. I started asking people if they needed help - neighbors, friends, family, strangers. Anything and anyone. I started spending my time thinking about others - and not in some \"I read about the people of Tibet and now can't get out of bed\" shit. Thinking about people in my life who I could help! An amazing thing happened - I stopped wanting to die because my life had purpose and community. Trust me - want to stop being suicidal? Find community (real community - ie people who want to see you as you) and find a purpose - a role someone else needs. For example - I shop for the lady next door who is elderly and afraid of COVID. Every time I want to die - I just imagine her being alone and confused as to why didn't answer her calls. This is one person, I have many now and I genuinely care about them! I always have cared about people. Do people take advantage? Sure. But who cares? I'm going to kill myself anyway right? I'll end by saying that this works for me - it may not in a year - but right now I am helping, and if I do die (by chance / by my own hand) my last days will be generous. I'll tell you, as soon as I start thinking only about myself and my problems then the suicidal thoughts come stampeding in. There's something to that... Maybe it's ego, maybe it's being disgusted with my own selfishness. The world needs good people right now... It can't hurt to try helping. Be safe out there! Being helpful should not put you in danger! Think about what you are comfortable doing (maybe a hotline / reading to old people) start there.

Something like GPT-3 qualifies as \"artificial expert intelligence,\" which is a type of AI that can do *multiple* tasks but has not achieved full generality. When you train GPT-3 to do something, it can still do loads of other stuff. A GPT-3 trained on images can still do math and summarize text, and it can also create basic apps. That's completely unlike any AI before the present, where there was a separate algorithm and script for each and every one of those tasks.\n\nSomething like a recursively-improving multimodal GPT-5 could very well be the first AGI, an AI that is capable of doing just about anything and everything it's trained to do without catastrophic forgetting or a need to retrain the entire model on a brand new corpus of data. But that's the rub: now that AGI is within sight, it's becoming clear that the first ones will *not* be godlike superhuman consciousnesses but rather something closer to what I'd call \"general-purpose AI\" (which you'd think \"artificial general intelligence\" would cover well, but AGI has become overly romanticized of a term)— imagine Siri, Alexa, Wolfram Alpha, GANs, Jukebox, GPT-3, optimization algorithms, expert systems, DeepMind's gameplaying bots, etc. all wrapped up in one neat package. That's what first-gen AGI is going to be like, and it'll still be super-amazing. It's also easily only 2 to 5 years away at most.

{"article": "Suicide is unfortunately really prevalent in my community. An aunt completed suicide before I was born, an upstairs neighbour, my neighbour in a college dorm, a former neighbour (a 17 year old child), a former friend's mother, a high-school acquaintance, and very recently, a friend of a friend's mother. These exclude all the local people I have read about online but never had the chance to meet. In March 2018 I had a clear, minimal pain plan for completing suicide after spending several weeks planning. The pause in my planning came from receiving some exciting news delivered at the end of March, and admittedly I became too busy trying to fight off smaller fires to return to that plan afterwards, otherwise I'm confident I would have gone through with the plan. Thinking back, I find it interesting that I didn't even consider how my loved ones would react/how much hurt it would bring. Thinking about suicide as a means to an end restricted me to a sort of tunnel vision that meant I had 0 consideration for my parents, partner, best friends, etc. especially because I was so attached to all these people. One thing I did repeatedly was reach out for help but probably through the wrong avenues e.g. friends who were incredibly stressed themselves and a student-run crisis service at my university called AMS Speakeasy that honestly made the problem worse (so glad they sacked the service). I'm in a better place now, I feel like I have a stronger grasp on things that make life meaningful, and I have greater intuition on warning signs so that I know to seek actual, professional help. I still feel deeply saddened for those lost to suicide. I wish there was some combination of words that would assure people considering suicide to reach out for help (the repercussions are minimal in case the help is not what's expected and help sometimes requires self-advocacy to get to the right professional who clicks), that there is some solution out there that will always be the better option to suicide (it may not be clear and you may not have an idea of it in the present, but it will unfold with time), even when it is tempting as a logical means to an end, the hurt and the numbness eventually gets better without suicide and makes you incredibly strong, and there is always a significant role for you on this planet as someone who loves and is loved.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 451, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "I've read this thread a lot lately and it's bringing me a measure of comfort on a Saturday night by myself. I hope no one minds hearing me and is understanding, because this is my first post on Reddit.  I have Bipolar Disorder type 1 and I was diagnosed right after I graduated college, which was ten years ago. The suicide ideation was really bad at that time.  My first boyfriend at the time knew I was showing signs of BP and did nothing to help me/showed no concern--he was having an affair with a girl younger than me (they're actually getting married--found out by accident).  It began 10 years of meds, therapy, partial hospitalization programs, and the first of 10 hospitalizations.  Then there was a period of time where I seemed to be okay and met someone who I had more in common with and who I loved dearly.  10 months into our relationship, we had just gotten off the train, and as his way of breaking up with me, told me that he only dated me because he pitied me.  It felt like a gut punch and I almost threw myself onto the tracks because I felt it confirmed my worst fear, that people only were around me out of pity and nothing else. What he said to me that night, magnified my sense of  shame and self loathing.  This was back in 2013.  Not long after that, I overdosed  on an anti-anxiety medication and ended up having two major seizures that nearly left me brain-damaged.    \n\n\nThe hospitals themselves sort of helped, but then I was assaulted at one (one that was well regarded in the area that I live in).  Workers on the ward watched the whole thing and did nothing to help me, which made it worse.  That was also in 2013.  My last hospitalization was in 2014, thank God.    \n\n\nAnyway , that the context ( and I hope it isn't too long) behind all this. While I still think about it, especially now in the midst of the pandemic and the loneliness that I feel and not being able to find work in my field,  I think what kept me from not doing it again was my mom.  She is everything to me and I couldn't do that to her--it would destroy her.   The other thing is a little different.  I was a film major in college and I worked in television as an assistant video editor until I had to leave my job (change of location, which would have resulted in me reliving a trauma that I couldn't shake) which I loved.  I spent and still spend a lot of time watching movies and the way I keep thinking about my life is like in scenes: \"Stay a little longer--you gotta see the next scene.  What's around the corner?  It might not be bad or hopeless.\"  I still try to my best to think this way, to think of the scenes that might be up ahead.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 460, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

Go to the mall with her, kick her ass in Mario Kart, laugh with her, go for a drive with her in the passenger seat and no real destination, and even if just for a weekend; have a friendship fully unimpeded by the hundreds of miles that separate us.

I wasn’t cutting my wrists but randomly on my upper arms, which caused a lot of people to brush it off as accidental cuts done in the set design/ modeling workshop or scratches from my dog.

He moved after that year and we never really stayed in contact. \n\n2. Spite- I hated people (and probably still do not gonna lie) so much that I didn’t want the people that are just there in my daily life to have the chance to pretend to care about me. I think this came from the fact that a lot depressing current shit happened locally during my sophomore year that people kinda romanticized the dark stuff. It aggravated me so much that I stayed alive just as a big “fuck you” to those people who acted like that. It was a really bad reason to stay alive and a really toxic “ I’m not like the other kids” mindset I had, but it keeper me alive during sophomore and junior year. \n\n3. The thing that kept me alive but also was probably contributing to my suicidal thoughts was my anxiety. I signed up to be a part of a lot of extra curriculars throughout all of high school, such as tech crews for theater shows and other schedule depending activities.

I'd always been poor and struggling so this was huge. But the last 3 years have been hell for my wife and me. Literally every 3-4 weeks we had some major life event. A very unexpected young death in the family, a critically sick pet, cancer (100% cancer free now), stuff going wrong with the house, car wrecks, everything. You name it and it happened to us. So while I was making really good money, it was going out as fast as I could make it due to all this stuff going on. Any savings we had was long gone. I hit the point where I couldn't process anymore and my brain overloaded. After the suicide stuff, I talked with both sides of my family about everything and they told me they wouldn't let us be homeless or without food. Took a ton of pressure off me and really helped me knowing I had such a strong support system.\n\nYou've probably been doing this too, but if you haven't I highly recommend having hobbies.

I've been building guitars, brewing beer, wood working and making things for my wife, making music, watching tv shows I always wanted to see, exercising again. It really helps to remind me I have value and I can still do things. The thought of having lost brain function is scary, but when I can prove to myself I can still do things well, it really helps me to feel better about myself.

I’d never experienced anxiety until she’d betrayed me like she had. \n\nI was a wreck, I was so unbelievably unstable and for so long I considered just ending it all, a twisted part of me (incredibly selfish part of me) thought that not only would I feel better, but it would make her realize the severity of her wrong doings. \n\nI realized how twisted and selfish this was and I quickly snapped out of it but I was still suicidal for some time.

I had developed varicose veins not long before, and I knew that if you cut one of those suckers they bled quickly. My plan was to go to the local park after my shift finished (so, late at night), find a remote spot, cut one of those bulging veins in my calf, and then even if I changed my mind, I'd bleed to death before I could get help.\n\nI remember feeling cheerful during my shift; I felt chipper, and upbeat. I wasn't expecting that - I've since learned that suicidal people will often appear happy just before they kill themselves, because they know that their problems will soon be over.\n\nI finished my shift - sinks, floors, buckets, doors, lights, dumb waiter, and washing machines all tended to - and walked to the park.\n\nI found a remote spot - I can point it out on Google Maps to this day - rolled up my jeans leg, put the sharp knife against the bulge of my varicose vein - and stopped.\n\nOne cut was all it would take. I remember the sharp feeling of the teeth of the knife against my skin. I remember how a hair got caught in the serrations of the knife.\n\nWHAT STOPPED ME: two things stopped me.

I hadn't had a proper girlfriend by that point, so it always amazed me that we got on so well, and that she found me to be so interesting and funny, when no-one else seemed to. I don't even remember her name now, but we had been getting on really well and the image of her jumped into my mind.\n\nI put the knife away and walked home, expecting Hell to erupt, as it had earlier that day. Actually, it was quiet. It had all blown over, and all the bullshit that had been so serious and definite and final had blown over. When I went to work next I put the steak knife back. I've thought many times since of how many customers must have used that thing subsequently, with no idea of what I had planned to use it for.\n\nI went to university the following year and it was awesome; you had to pick your own crowd, and you had to look for fun sometimes, but even so it was epic. It was so much better than I had even hoped. I graduated 4 years later with an BSc (Hons). No-one, NO-ONE, at uni knew what I had gone through prior to enrolling. All they knew, and all they still know - apart from one guy I told when we discussed stuff like this one night - all they knew is I was in love with uni and remain really sentimental about those times, but they don't know is that going to uni totally saved me.\n\nI've just used Google Maps to measure how far that secluded spot was from my uni residences - it's 12.3 miles in a straight line.

I learned 3 years within 2 weeks and got just good enough to pass my examen with passable grades.\nThank you Yu-Gi-Oh, some may find you childish or stupid, but you were a place of comfort during my darkest days.

{"article": "TLDR: Perfectionism and Wanting to Write Kept Me From Suicide\n\nI was actively suicidal from about 13-14 though I had I had suicidal ideations before and after that time (severe depression caused by CPTSD). When you're suicidal that young you don't really have a great concept of time so it's hard to see how things will likely be better in the future. You also don't care about how the things you do in the moment will affect you in the future. Didn't do go to school ever? Doesn't matter, I'm gonna die before I graduate. Didn't brush my teeth for weeks on end? Who cares, I'm gonna die before it becomes a problem. I only say all this to give you some perspective on how much apathy you have when you think that you're going to die any day now and how many of the things that help adults get through a depression don't really work on kids because you haven't lived long enough to see that things will get better over time.\n\nIn all honesty once you're at that point (ready and willing to die at any moment) theres not a ton that can stop you so your subconscious kinda has to get creative. Pretty much the only thing that got me through it was this internal drive I had to write a book. I have no idea why, I guess I just always wanted to write ever since I can remember. Family and friends were obviously huge as well but I honestly just saw myself as a burden to them so killing myself felt like the merciful option for both of us. The only way I could ever actually see myself as adding to the world, rather than taking away from it, was by eventually writing a book. I did write but it sucked (I was 13 so thats to be expected) but I was such a perfectionist  (and would compare my middle school writing to Ginsberg and Fitzgerald) that I was never happy with it. I knew I couldn't die until I had written that book though, so I kept writing. The idea of dying without creating something seemed really embarrassing to me for some reason so writing was more motivating to me than suicide. I never finished the book, I had such insane standards for myself then that even if it was good I never could have accepted it. Eventually I had been writing for so long that the therapy and meds started to work and I no longer felt like I needed to kill myself once I had written something \"perfect\". I always think of my procrastination and self sabotage at that time of my life as my subconscious trying to protect me.\n\nA lot of the time that's how people end up not killing themselves, you just distract yourself for long enough for the healing to work. The reasons people decided to kill themselves or not to seem really silly to people on the outside but pay attention to them because they're the thing thats deciding between someones life and death.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 543, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "My girlfriend, partner and best friend, who are one and the same person. I was in a very unhealthy relationship when I met her, one of those where neither of you have the mental wellbeing to look at the relationship clearly and see its not working anymore. Both of us had lots of personal issues and communication was bad because of it. When I met my current partner it was like I saw the light, I remembered how fulfilled I can be. This led me to have a long overdue honest conversation with my now ex, and we broke up after. It was a messy breakup, logistically more than personally, but during lockdown we reached out to each other (were a few years down the line now) and talked about it and how we both worked on ourselves afterwards. My current partner helped me work through a lot of the issues I had with self loathing, depression and confidence and showed me how to appreciate the little things in life again. My biggest advice if you're feeling suicidal, or going there, is to look for beauty, as in little things you can let yourself be amazed by, it can be something as simple as smelling a flower on a walk and appreciating its scent. For me a big part of the hole I used to be in was spending too much time in my own head with my worries and insecurities and not enough appreciating what's outside my head. Your brain will deem things you focus on a lot to be highly important, so if you are spending most of your time indoors, alone and with your own thoughts it doesn't always end up as an enlightening meditation let's say. Identify your habits, the ones that enforce this mind-cycle, and make those habits more conducive to appreciating the good things around you. A good generalised place to start these days, in my opinion, is to deactivate your social media for a week or two and see how you feel. We think about social media as a great way to fend of the doom of boredom, but I suggest inviting boredom into your life and see if it pushes you to do something more wholesome than scrolling for minutes or (more likely) hours. Another thing that has helped me is growing plants, just one or two, that I look after every morning, it helps to create a routine, and a sense of routine does wonders for your mental peace (yes, even if you are a free spirited hippy like myself).\n\nTLDR: I have a wonderful partner who inspired me to believe in my own worth and adapt some healthier habits into my daily routine that inspire healthier thought patterns.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 551, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "I have a small literary nonsense book I keep unpublished that I wrote as a teenager trying to be as a random as possible, and I kept a razor blade in it for self-harm.  I was going through severe depression and severe social anxiety during the 2008 recession and living in my parents' living room, since there wasn't a better space for me sleep having briefly moved out and giving up a bedroom to one of my siblings.  Around this time I was trying out different anti-anxiety/anti-depressant meds while my top front teeth were rotting out from choosing to drink soda and being too depressed to brush my teeth.  This where I started a novel with an actual story that I finished 12 years later, this year in 2020, doing all the revision myself which was the hardest work of my life.\n\nI thought about the ideas of \"Write what you would love to read.\"  And \"Write what you want to exist but doesn't yet.\"  I had fond a memory of walking around at night, at age 18 with a past friend, I was wearing all black including a trenchcoat, and drunk on vodka, which was hard for an 18-year-old to get in my small town.  Though I had officially branded myself goth since 16.  So when I finally decided to write a book, I thought about how quiet, stable, and empty small towns are at night, and I thought about what the opposite would look like, a place where there are other people dressed strangely, or acting strangely, and where the environment is so unstable it feels alive.\n\nThen I took it a step further and had the main character battling mental illness, but not particularly goth, and suddenly waking up trapped in this insane city (and having her eyes replaced with microscope ends by a disembodied voice in a Wal-Mart).  But I wanted to completely nail the ending and I feel like it took the full 12 years to do that.  I wanted the most heartfelt but striking ending that I could get.  I gave up in frustration many times over the years, especially with revising, but with David Goggins philosophy and the resulting constant stress and pseudomyopia I achieved my goal.  The moral of the story is while I no longer have severe depression or severe social anxiety, writing a book didn't help much for my mental illness at all, and my immediate family and friends don't care about reading it, so maybe don't write a book.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 557, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

The story captivates and haunts me to this day. \n\n\nThe interesting thing is I don't personally know the person. I followed a blog of a world-traveling husband and wife and I got invested in their adventures. I came to like them as people and viewed them as kindred spirits. When they returned home is when it happened, the wife went out for a walk and never came home. The story made the news as she was missing for a time. I saw the terrible pain the husband went through. I saw the anguish in her parent’s eyes. It shocked me, but it also made me reflect on my own depression. I too have been a traveler my whole life, I left home at 18 to work on a cruise ship and have never been back. I’ve been through multiple careers, put myself through college, lived in half a dozen countries and visited well over 50. No one would suspect that I would suffer from crippling depression and had planned suicide. No one wants to hear that someone with all those experiences feels depressed; “What do you have to be depressed about?”. I’ve got the world by the ass right? I’m an asshole for feeling this way, or perhaps it’s a way to humble brag? The problem is the more I see, the less I feel I know. Instead of filling a hole inside of me, that hole gets bigger. Travel is a drug and withdrawals are real and severe for some. I know the feeling of despair that comes to some of us when we are rooted to one place and the traveling stops. At first I tried to rack it up to the normal sadness that comes to most people when a vacation or long trip ends, but its more than that. I felt alone and like no one took that seriously until this traveler took her own life. \n\n\nJosh and Leanne Bearden are that couple.

{"article": "**TL;DR Math. Death may bring relief to suffering but it comes at a cost and if your final choice. Life allows you to choose to increase happiness and endure bad days.**  \nMath. It just didn't make logical sense for me to die. If I have interacted 500 people in my past, 250 of them would probably be acquaintances that on average have 1-2 bad days for 1-5 years, not horrible and probably don't stray much from an normal death, but will be some grief and mourning. Let's call that 750 bad day points for a lifetime.    \n50 or so of those will be colleagues, basic friends, and direct contacts. There lives will probably change because of my death. Probably 30-100 days the first year tapering off from there. I from personal experience with even basic death and suicide death at this level that feels about right. I still remember a few normal deaths which bring mild loss but also glad I was able to know them. So probably looking at 500 points just in the first year. From there? idk maybe another 1000 for a lifetime.   \nYour family size will greatly affect the last category but will keep it simple because I hope everyone has at least 2 people in their lives that are extremely close. These two people are going to wake up every morning wondering what they could have done. They personally realize what \"How to save a Life\" really means and will cry almost every time it's played. They will feel a pain you can never experience because they continue to choose life. Take whatever pain you are currently feeling and multiply it by this group of people. I have got to talk with personally since I have decided to live with a few people in this category. Some are extremely old 60-80+ and they may not remember a lot but they still remember that person. So 2x a lifetime of bad day points.  \nDeath is a tragic experience for most humans. We cherish life. No matter how dark and bad it is, no matter how helpless you feel. You have two choices right now life or death. Once you choose death that is your only choice. If you are successful you can never choose this life again. We don't have the technology today. Once you die your pain is multiplied and additional bad day points are added to humanity. I hope you don't have to live a lifetime of bad days and hopefully you can choose life and make one good day for you and someone else. 2x40y+1500+750 bad days &gt; 100y of bad days, and this was what  I calculated when I was 17. I am going to chose to turn 40 years old soon.  I will tell you even with a lot of counseling I still have really bad days bad enough to still feel suicidal, but I have had a lot of EXTREMELY good days too. Days so good that I multiplied the happiness on earth by at least 3!

Even though we had a strained relationship, I was devastated. Within minutes of getting the news, I told my mother, suicide will never again be an option for me.\n\n Experiencing that pain and despair instantly made me vow to never put my kids, or anyone else I love, through that. It has now been over 10 years since he passed, and I am still in terrible shape around the time of year he died. It is a pain that will never go away. \n\nIn a weird way, he kind of took my security blanket away from me. Regardless of how bad things got, I was able to get some comfort knowing \"I can end it all, if it gets too bad\". It was MY CHOICE to continue on.  Now that suicide is no longer an option for me, I am forced to choose, be miserable for the rest of my life, or do something to help myself. Soon after, I entered a PTSD treatment program through the VA. Support groups and intensive treatment have helped me turn things around.

{"article": "I just grew up. \n\nSuicide is such a vanity/cry for attention kind of thing in my opinion. And there's nothing wrong with that, everyone's mental health needs attention sometimes, talking about suicide/depression is typically the best way to get attention. \n\nIf I think about it these days I don't tell anyone, I just decide against it and move on, I don't care for the attention anymore. And maybe I'm being callous since I dont think about it much these days. I've actually realized how afraid i am of not being here, and would prefer to stay. It wasn't that easy at first but I'm older now. I dont live with my parents any more so there's a higher sense of responsibility that I have for myself, my problems dont belong to anyone else.\n\n\"Woe is me I watched 13 reasons why now I wanna do it too! Oh my stock broker fucked me and my fortune is gone.. My wife left me my husband cheated bla bla bla.\" Maybe there is a real chemical imbalance that I had, that a lot of people still do really have, but I think it's more philosophical than that.\n\nPeople realize that there are two possibilities, life and death, they're unhappy in their current state and look around for an easy fix, they dont see one nearby but they do see an escape, that's all it is, an escape route. I guess I kind of look at it like a game these days. You opted in to enjoy the game and get the most out of it, whether you realize it or not. Now that you're here you find the difficulty too high? Tough shit I guess. Keep playing or leave, no one really cares in the end except those that are close to you, but they'll move on and live their lives without you if they must.\n\nI think my mom is a good example because she was going through really hard times mentally when my parents were splitting. She talked about suicide often but I think she's too much of a narcissist to actually do it, she is in love with herself and her possessions. When I was in Jr High I was so scared to lose my girlfriend, that was world ending for me for some reason. I think back now and it's all so silly. I bet my mom probably does too, she's doing fine now.\n\nEveryone on this website will tell you how much they care, how worth it it all is, they don't, it's probably not.\nNo one cares in the real world. You either live or you die, enjoy yourself or get the fuck out, it doesn't seem to have any real meaning in the end.\n\nSo what? You're left with this strange human experience where you gotta work to live and in the mean time try to just be happy.\n\nNone of us asked to be here but we're making do, you should too. Or like I said, don't, I legitimately dont care, not saying that to be edgy, just genuine. When I was in that state, I could not stand all the people telling me how much they care, how you should stick around, it's like a fucking cable provider trying to convince you not to unsubscribe to their ridiculously priced packages.\n\nWatch tv or don't, no one gives a shit!", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 600, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "My family...as cliche as it sounds. I thought about them being at my funeral, crying, and watching my casket be lowered in the ground. I wanted to die, but I didn’t want to hurt my family by going through with it. The truth is you never stop having suicidal thoughts, you just learn to better manage them. You start learning to recognize irrational thoughts and nipping them in the bud. You start learning to let go of things that you used to hold on to so tightly in the past by recognizing that it’s hurting you. It takes a long time to get to this point. It is not an easy task and no one should feel bad because they didn’t reach this point. It takes a lot of bravery to face your feelings, trauma, and just unrelenting self hatred head on. It’s a long and tiresome journey, but end of the day you have grown from it.\n\nAnother thing was realizing was how much I would miss out on if I died...hell I made a list. Looking back now I’m so grateful that my suicide attempts didn’t work. I’m thankful that my mental health now is manageable and when I talk about it, people actually take me seriously. That I recognized in some capacity that I wasn’t okay and reached out to talk to someone. That for once in my life that I was absolutely honest about how I was feeling and knowing the why behind it. You have to recognize the bad and the good things in your life, and sometimes it takes hitting absolute rock bottom to get you there. To learn. To grow. To know the why. Sometimes the biggest nightmare is being able to face who we truly are, damage and all. To feel so vulnerable about the damage that was left behind and trusting someone enough to not fix you, but show you how to fix and heal yourself.

I wrote down how I felt in a letter and gave it to her to read in front of me because when I get emotional I always forget what I want to say. The letter boiled down to confessing my love and either dating or cutting ties. After reading she said she needed to think about it. I texted her the next day. No response. Texted a week later. Nothing. Over a month later she finally agreed to meet up to have a talk. She had me run errands with her while we talked and didn't give me any respect.

But she is me now, so I honor that time in my life by loving myself now. Depression sucks. Some days, it’s hard to just brush my teeth and comb my hair, but I understand that those days don’t last forever. \n\nTake care of yourself. You matter.

{"article": "I had a few friends who I wanted to stay around, and I wanted to be of help to someone instead of being just useless. Now, I force thoughts of it down even if they are there every day, and I owe it to my amazing friends who support me every day through all the things I do. In the end I think it really is all about your own mindset though. You can have all the support in the world and it wont mean a thing if you refuse to let it will you forward. You have to stubbornly cling to life. Scream in the face of adversary no matter how scary it is to look it in the eye, to see the faces of those who mock you daily and are a good cause of your depression be it family, classmates, or coworkers. You have to fight and keep your head above the water and keep breathing. Because if you let it pull you down it becomes so hard to breathe that you sometimes start to lose it. The chains on those thoughts become a little bit looser. You get left along for a few hours with nothing to do any your mind wanders, so you run away from idleness. You keep yourself occupied like your life depends on it. Because it does. Because deep inside you you know that if your not moving forward if you aren’t working on something and improving no matter what it is, you might lose control. You find the reins on your own mind are a lot looser than you thought they were, and it starts moving towards that same familiar cliff. Sometimes you just take a blow and your entire mind starts racing and stops completely all at the same time. It might be the death of a close friend, a pet, whatever else. But it hits you harder than a truck. It makes you want to get hit by a truck. And when that happens you have to fight but you cant bear to move. But you have to fight you have to have that will to move forward because you have to believe that no matter what there is a light at the end of the tunnel. No matter what your belief system is, there ARE good people in this world and you CAN do so much good in the world if you just will yourself forward. In the end you are fighting your own mind but you just have to believe that the end reward is worth it. \n...\nThis is what it is like inside of my mind. I have had to fight thoughts of worthlessness for years and years. My family has never helped. But sometimes you find real family in the amazing friends you can make along the way. I keep those thoughts locked in a cage pushed far, far beneath the surface. And even still I feel them every day. To everyone else fighting like me, please, keep fighting.

{"article": "I tried to kill myself a few years ago. At the time, I felt absolutely nothing. It was nothing like that depressed sad, numbish feeling one might feel when they would think about doing it. It was just nothing. I was so empty and hollow. I didn’t think things like “no one loves me” I knew they did. I knew my suicide would crush them. I just didn’t care. I didn’t love them anymore. I couldn’t love anything anymore. I had no anger or sadness or happiness. I didn’t even particularly care if I died or not, it just felt like it needed to be done. Like a chore. I felt like I had already died, I just had to make my body figure it out, too.\nI tried to give myself alcohol poisoning bc I thought it would be the least painful but ended up waking up the next day. I had a panic attack and passed out before I could drink that much. I wasn’t upset that I failed or relieved that I could have another chance at life. I was nothing. I got up and went to work that day. I worked at Taco Bell and would talk to customers like nothing was wrong. I realized I probably didn’t have enough alcohol to actually die anyway and didn’t have the money to buy more.\nIn a moment of feeling, I tried to tell my mom, but I had already been to the hospital for that same thing earlier that year and nothing came of it bc I lied while I was there. Because of that my mom said I can’t go to the hospital every time I feel sad. I tried to kill myself again that night too by swallowing pills and playing my first and favorite video game (loz: wind waker)for as long as I could. I realized I didn’t take enough and was going to take the rest of the bottle but sister came home that night before I could. I thought she’d already been in bed. She stayed up and hung out with me and watched me play. She had no idea. When she went to bed I threw up in the sink and just went to sleep.\nA week later I was going to try again. The whole bottle at once this time. At this point I was going in and out of feeling absolute nothingness. I ended up getting a call for a job interview that same day. Id been staying with my family bc I couldn’t pay the electricity and heat bill for my apartment anymore. I was in the brink of eviction. That call and that job saved me. I had thought of killing myself for a long time after getting that job. It very slowly got better. \nThe biggest thing that helped was a book series I love called called Stormlight Archives. There’s this motto a group in there has that goes “life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination” it was that last bit that helped me. If I was going to die eventually anyway, might as well give my life at least some chance I guess. The biggest thing was my dad also likes that series and he was the one who highlighted the “journey before destination” bit to me. He’s the smartest man I’ve ever known and the only one I’ve met who sees the world like I do and enjoys the same style of creativity in the same way I do. He’s the only one I could talk to about the ideas I had in my head where we would help me develop them. I love writing fictional short stories. It was the first time I worried ever about letting someone down. I am definitely still not very okay. My gender identity and my adhd often makes me drift into sadder thoughts, but I have an appt to get a psych referral tomorrow so I guess that’s good. Plus, from my experience, feeling sad is still safe. It’s that indescribable hollow nothingness that is dangerous. I think that might be the difference between suicidal ideation and being suicidal. It’s scary how quickly I stopped loving those I had loved with all of my heart just a few days before. I am okay with being sad. Nothingness is much more terrifying. I never want to be there again. I never want to attempt suicide again.\nI never told my anyone about this. No one in my family has a clue I even tried at all.

I get mad at things miniscule and can't go on social media or i lose my shit at the baby like posts complaining about problems that aren't important. Therapy didn't help. Friends and family didn't help and I was at my lowest point right after my son was born. After I blew through money drugs and alcohol trying to cope with it was worse then ever. So I reached out to my grandmother who has dealt with 2 suicides and the loss of a daughter from a drunk driver. She helped me the most. I never knew why she was always so damn happy and she said that at some point you have to make a choice.

{"article": "I have ongoing mental health problems. I have rock bottom self esteem. For as long as I can remember I really haven’t liked myself much at all. There are reasons which seem so minuscule and unimportant to others but to me they are very significant. That has then excused me from acting like a decent person on occasion and led me to do things a nice person wouldn’t do. Nothing awful, but some emotionally detached things. Bad behaviour. A couple of years ago I was at a point where I hated myself so much that I thought about ending it all. I was driving home from work, a job I hated, to a home at that time I wasn’t happy in. I was having a meltdown, a full on anxiety attack in the car and I decided I was going to drive into the concrete central reservation on the bridge at 70+ MPH and that would be me. So I was approaching the bridge in my car, tears streaming down my face, teeth gritted and the car speeding up. Then I thought to myself, “what kind of arsehole does that? What kind of fucking cunt would cause an accident on a main road, a bridge, and cause all these people to stop and get home late? What a cunty thing to do.” And so I slowed down a bit, pulled myself together, and realised that no matter how little I like myself, I wasn’t **that** much of a shithead. And the following day I made an appointment at the docs, and was out on antidepressants. And slowly I’ve been getting better. I’m still a long way off being fixed but I’m better. So really what I’m saying is, no matter how bad you think things are, they can always be worse, and you can always fix what’s wrong. I found some things I’m good at, woodworking and stuff, I picked up a few things I loved doing from my youth and started them again. It’s better than any medicine.

I was also in a new relationship and couldn't bear the thought of hurting her. And then I guess I figured that meant that there were people who deep down I knew did care and would be affected.

{"article": "My reason was that if I kill myself I will turn into a ghost, I heard it from a Guru, and since Im a believer of past life it made sense to. I know it sounds lame, but the real cause was that after turning myself into a ghost I won't be able to do anything no matter how hard I try, but in real life hardwork always pays off, and no matter how hard it gets today there will definitely be a day when everything will be ok. There are hundreds of stories of many succesful peoples proving that. So, this is what kept me going. \n     7years ago  I was diagonised with a chronic disease. When the doctor said that i will never be cured and infact it will get worse day by day (and it did), at first I was a bit worried about myself, but I never believed those doctor's words for me as truth. Something inside me always kept me saying that Im gonna be cured one day. Two years later my mom and dad started quarelling with each other and day by day it got worse and 1year later they got seperated. After that me and my mom went to live with my aunt (mom's sister). And by then I got so weak that I was unable to do any kind of work properly. I was even unable to go out of the house cause I was too weak to stand up if the fall down. So, I was locked inside the house for about 2 years. Those days were so miserable. I was 17-18 years old and all my friends were having fun and I was locked inside my home. At this phase I was really struggling with myself. Sucidal thought occured very often But, I still kept going and now finally after 3 years of struggling I finally succeded in curing myself. 7 years earlier being diagonised with that disease might seem like a curse after 7 years later I realized that it was actually a blessing. It made me so much wiser, it helped me find my passion, it made me realize how beautiful mother nature is, it taught me to love the earth, to love everyone, to love my life and most impotantly to love myself. \n      I just want to say that no matter how hard life gets, there is always hope and just keep in mind that everything happens for a reason and that reason is for your own good.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 642, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

They found any excuse they could to make fun of me; from my clothes to my tits to the way I talked. I didn't have any friends, and I felt like the world would be better off without me. For months, I gathered up any pills that I could find laying around the house, until I had a small trinket box full of them. I spent that time writing letters to everyone I loved.

After one year my dad, in a desperate attempt to get me to go to school and play football, delivers the ultimatum \"You either need to go to school or move out.\"  \nSo I committed to moving out with my best friend and another mutual friend we knew from an anime convention. The next year directly after I moved out were probably the hardest year of my life in terms of mental health. I was working an overnight freight job sleeping maybe 4 hours a day. I was never able to see my friends, even the ones I lived with, because of opposing work schedules. I almost lost my job because I was calling out sick so frequently due to depression.  \nLooking back on it, the only thing that kept me going was video games. Between playing my old favorites to distract from the negative thoughts and \"holding out\" for the next release that I was excited about or finding that gem I'd missed my life outside of work revolved around games.  \n   \nAfter a year of hell I switched to working days and my health immediately improved. Physical and mental. I also met a slew of new friends, and due to working with the public, I developed social skills from frequently interacting with different kinds of people (retail job).  \nA year after switching, my best friend decides to move to the next state over to go to college, and I end up moving in with a coworker and some now mutual friends. From this point in my life, is wear the healing really starts and I begin to sort through my shit and figure out whats going on with my thoughts. The thoughts are still there but the times when they take over my life have become rare, and it’s never for nearly as long as when I was in school or right after I moved out...with one exception dealing with a broken heart but I'll give myself a pass on that one. \nFor the last few years, whenever I have a severe bout of suicidal thoughts, my main reason for not wanting to go through with it my loved ones. I don't have an SO or kids but I cherish my friends like family.  \n  \nTL;DR\nMy mom, I promised myself I'd finish highschool, Video games, my friends.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 656, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

I made probably 100+ friends online, pissed off a majority of them and only speak and hang out with 1-2 of them now. IRL was completely different. I met probably 15-20 people, befriending all and sleeping with about half of them (which led to rough fallouts because as I learned you really shouldn’t fuck your friends while you’re depressed and suicidal and don’t know how to control your emotions quite yet). All in all, I spitefully went to therapy and spitefully sought friendships for years and years because I was so determined to prove I was better off dead and nothing could prove otherwise.

I have so many physical and emotional scars from my past, and so many regrets of things I did to myself and others, but I don’t regret failing to prove I don’t deserve to live.

{"article": "I will be the odd one out... at the risk of being downvoted into oblivion, but with the hope of helping even one person... after a traumatic brain injury over two years ago, I was in the worst place of my life. I was fully convinced the world (and even my own husband and children) would be better off without me in their lives. \n\nWhat helped me was chelation. Yes, therapy for heavy metal poisoning. All of my post-concussion symptoms mirrored mercury poisoning to the brain: dizziness, nausea, memory problems, depression/anxiety... I knew I had mercury exposure in childhood due to dental amalgams (and improper removals in adulthood which increased mental health issues later in my life).\n\nWhen I began Chelating, it was within a short week or two that I began to see tremendous gains. And having all those suicidal ideations was a thing of the past--never to return. \n\nTaking control of my health in that way was a huge part of what saved me. In those early months (I didn't begin chelating until about six months after my injury), it was difficult to find the motivation to keep going. But when I began to take control over what I could control (what I ate, taking my vitamins, etc.), I found a lot of comfort.\n\nI am happy to talk more specifics about what helped me through PMs, though please know that I am not selling any product or promoting anything that will make me any money. The chelators I used included vitamins that can be purchased from any health food store, and each dose cost me fractions of a penny. No one stands to make insane amounts of money from this therapy. I share because it gives my struggle purpose and helps me to help those who may be in a similar situation and looking for a way out. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.

Well I started to get into necromancy for a while and I read the book 'the necronomicon. It's pretty neat and has some cool circles n shapes but nothing ever came of it.

These kinda go hand in hand in helping create wack dreams almost reaching levels of meditation. Through my learning of this stuff I came across the idea of the Tulpa I thought it was interesting 'sharing my brain with another being? Sure why not.' I was really lonely at the time... so I went about doing and through this forced lucid dreaming and trying to create another personality in my head and it worked.

{"article": "every time i made up my made about killing myself i felt much better, nothing seemed to affect me any longer. this made me realize how feelings aren't as objective and universal as we may think they are. you can pass through a terrible situation without suffering just because you convinced yourself that it's gonna be over soon and nothing will matter later. think all that this can imply for a moment.\n\nI'll copy-paste something i wrote about this somewhere else, where i explain how it worked for me:\n\n\"Being a teenager, I realized that whenever I planned suicide seriously and commited to follow the plan, instantly everything felt lighter.\n\nTaking my own death as a fact that was soon-to-be, it felt like nothing was holding me back any longer: I had no business with this world and thus nothing had power over me and my decisions. This how I first realized how this all works, and ironically, observing that mind state made me retract from killing myself. I spent so much time trying to replicate this effect without putting suicide in the equation, and I learned a lot from it. \n\nThere seems to be a perceptual state of being that is naturally at hand, in which we perceive ourselves as \"the center\" of our existence, fearless, unaffected and unrestrained. It is, mainly, a \"sense/perception\" kind of thing, but may be completely affected by beliefs. Holding any belief that causes you fear makes this perceptive state impossible, unless you make the object of fear, and its harm, irrelevant to you. Accepting death as a possible event in any moment, and clearing anything that blocks that acceptance in your mind, makes the road to that perceptual state almost straight. Also the acceptance that all possession and power is illusory, it's just an unacceptance of the weakness of all matter, and that everything is elusive of direct and real control (everything but oneself being without any fear). In short, it's the state of not feeling attached to the possible outcomes.\n\nThat's just how I manage, mostly. I hope it may help. \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nit sounds like a simple \"mind trick\", but or whole minds are made of those kinds of \"tricks\". we know that terrible things are happening in other places in the world, we know that there is homeless people dying miserable and alone, and we just keep with our lives as if nothing happens. how do we do that? we think that we follow an objective perspective of reality and the self, but we are actually used to doing lots of \"mind tricks\"", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 688, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

One of the nurses took me round the home to meet everyone and she took me into a room with a lady around 50 years of age who was bed ridden with tubes coming out of her body for every reason possible. This woman was breathing, eating, basically existing through tubes. The nurse explained to me that she had attempted suicide and this was the result. She couldn't talk or communicate to anyone and her family would only visit once or twice a year because they found it so upsetting. \nI remember at the time thinking that whatever was going on in this lady's life that made her want to end things; this must be worse.\nWhenever I start to struggle with anything, I think of the lady in the bed and remember that my problems are temporary, I can fix them or learn to live with them.

I owe my life to the gentleness, unconditional love and comfort from these creatures.\n\n-Talking to other depressed or suicidal people. This may sound weird and I think people would think we'd just give each other ideas or egg each other on or something, but it was so fucking nice to have an unfiltered conversation about genuinely wanting to die with someone else who understood. We could say really dark or fucked up things and it felt freeing and I felt a connection to someone which was important for me. Suicidal ideation can leave you feeling disconnected, especially if you surround yourself with people who flat out don't get it.\n\n-This may be controversial, and I don't recommend this for everyone, but it helped me. Self harm. It kept me here. Provided me with relief and release and escape. It grounded me and made me feel some semblance of what I thought being alive should feel like. I attribute this to the adrenaline rush. I understand this coping mechanism isn't healthy, and if you become addicted to it, it can be another personal hell to go through.\n\n-Another controversial one, but I'm just sharing my story. There's videos on the internet you can find of people killing themselves. It's awful, horrible, gut wrenching, makes me panic....but it detours me from considering suicide to be a genuine option. I think for me, I can kind of romanticize suicidal ideation if I just stay stuck in my head. My perception of suicide becomes completely warped. But when you actually see it happening, it's morbid and makes me feel sick and I hate everything about it, especially if it's a gruesome suicide. It's a harsh reality that snaps me back into reality.\n\nTW: I go into morbid detail.\n.\n.\n.\nA little background, I never officially attempted suicide, but I \"flirted\" with it. What I mean by that is I would, for example, tie something around my neck and over something where it would suspend me and choke me, and get up on the chair, but not jump off or move the chair. I would get into \"position\" more or less. Or I would put a plastic bag around my head to see what my last moments would be like before actually committing.\nSince those moments, I've been in therapy and I'm currently on Lexapro. I think medication has been a game changer for me. I still struggle with things, but suicide hasn't been an option for me for quite some time now.\nI hope someone who comes across this can relate, feel less guilty about things that are taboo to talk about, and hopefully inspire to get help or reach out or literally anything positive that can come from me sharing this.

I was still in 6th grade, and I kinda wanted to see some of my friends before I did it, so I made a plan where I faked having a sore throat so my dad would let me get some cough drops to school, and without him knowing, I grabbed way more than I actually need. I hadn’t really planned out how I was gonna overdose properly, because a few years later I learned that it’s not as easy as I thought it was to over dose on cough drops. However, on that day and for years afterward, I thought that I was really setting my self up to die. So I get to school, and met up with some of my friends in the cafeteria before school starts. I just wanted to se them all one more time, so after that I was ready. My first period was band class so since my teacher that day didn’t really have anything planned out for the day, I could easily go into the percussion only room and do it. I went in pulled out all the cough drops I had gotten, and was ready to end it. But then I had some trouble swallowing a few of them at once, and I hadn’t thought about taking a water bottle with me. There was a water fountain out side of the room, so I walked. over to it and was spotted by my teacher. Since it was a band class, she had a strict no candy rule to make sure nobody got the inside of their instrument gross, and percussionist had to also follow the rule to keep things fair. So, when she saw me with my mouth looking full, she assumed that I had candy in it and made me spit it out. After that i kinda just gave up for the day. After that, though I made more plans to kill myself in the future, I never actually got to any of them because of my friends. Even though they didn’t actually know that I had tried to do that until a few years later, they had been one of the first proper groups of friends that I actually had in life, and because I know that a lot of them were in similar or worse situations then me, I decided that I would keep myself alive for their sake. Know that I’m older, I’ve started realizing that I have to live for my own sake, but I can still be there for them regardless. So, given the fact that my suicide attempt failed for multiple reasons that just sort of happened, I consider what saved me to be luck.

We already had some financial trouble due to an incredible string of unfortunate life events over the last 2 years. I also have a couple health issues that put me in the high risk category at the ripe old age of mid 30s. I got the depression under control fairly quick but the anxiety aspect wasn't so quick to tame. Then the virus got bad here... That definitely put the anxiety into overdrive. I made the decision that I want to live and now there is a direct threat to my life. And it's damn near invisible too. Over half the cases show no symptoms but can infect people who would die if they catch it. Not that catching it is an immediate death sentence, but being high risk I definitely don't want to tempt fate. One of my therapists related it to the PTSD from Vietnam vets.

It definitely set me back a lot initially, but with the help of my doctor, the treatment plan, and my family, I'm making progress again.\n \nI also found out there may be a direct physical cause to most of my problems. Doctors and therapists ask tons of questions and things I didn't think were important actually are really significant. Like having 8-9 concussions over the last 15 years is pretty bad.

{"article": "Backstory:\nMy elder sister (27 back then) was the first grandchild of the family. She was always adored for 4years till I (23f) came into the picture. I was an “adorable doll-like girl and well-behaved child” according to my uncles and my sister hated that all the attention was taken away from her. She bullied me when we were kids like decapitating my Barbie doll or vandalised my toys. I would then learn she would not bully me intensely if I gave my sister spotlights to my parents. So I grew up learning to be comfortable being alone and not dependent on my parent’s affections. My parent did find me odd from then on.\n\nI prefer to stay in my room while she loves to watch some entertainment gossip channels which I hate. I prefer to either read books or do my own thing. The family likes to do social activities while I don’t, thus, branded me as “the family black sheep”.\n\nMy sister and I don’t get along as well when we were young adults as she is into cosmetic and looking pretty while I was a laid back and chill person (wearing just jeans and shirt most of the times) but got lots catcalled or stares by guys whenever we go out. I don’t entertain because I am not into such court etiquettes. My sister LOVES ATTENTIONS. \n\nSometimes, I would accidentally meet my sister outside and she would start talking crap about me in-front of my female friends. Not cool. \n\nFunnily enough, I always got free passes to popular clubs because the bouncers and the managers liked me for being a cool customer and my sister would ask me to get her and her friends inside for free (which I obliged). I don't mind as long as I don't have to entertain her inside.\n\nShe would always talk down to me about how I dress up or look while she dramatises her fabulous lush hotel working life as compared to my life. I don’t like to give her much retaliation by ignoring her and it irks her.\n\nSo back to the story:\nMy sister was found eating numerous painkillers and we called for the ambulance. It turns out that she wanted to commit suicide because she lost some money at the workplace and had to pay it out of her pocket. She couldn’t deal with the pressure and the Monster in her head made her think worst than the situation and she folded.\n\nMy mother (bless her) was so stressed and concerned about my sister. She was crying and blamed herself for my sister’s mess. I just went in the ER room and slapped her so hard that she was shocked that her passive younger sister did that to her. I incidentally am a nurse. The nurse was there when I slapped her and I demanded the nurse to go get an ice pack for my sister’s cheek.\n\nI looked at her like I am going to murder her and just said, “Apologize to mom! If you gonna take your own life, ask her permission because she is the one that bought you into the world!”. \n\nMy mom just cried even more. My dad was consoling my mom at this point. I just said sorry to my mom and left the hospital.\n\nFast forward to many years, both I and my elder sister are grown up and are mothers to wonderful children. My elder sister confessed to me that she was thankful I did what I did back then.  She told me that she thought my lack of responses to her “bullying” was me not caring about her and she didn’t think I was an option to talk to because we didn’t have the “sisterly bond”.

I hadn’t talked to my brother in approximately 3 days... he sent me a video of my 2 year old nephew playing with a Mickey Mouse plush doll I bought from him on our last family Disney trip about 3 months ago. For some reason that one video gave me back my entire will to live. It’s hard to explain but I burned the note, buried all suicidal tendencies and called my brother to come over and had the best day of my life afterwards.

I started taking a new anxiety medication that my mother was making me take and it made me feel significantly worse. I had constant brain fog, migraines, and ten fold increased anxiety and depression. On the second 3rd day of me taking it I hopped in a lobby with this friend and he immediately noticed that I was talking weird and that my gameplay was a bit off and he asked me if I was okay. I responded “I’m alright” and he replied with “no seriously, are you alright? I’m worried”. And those words to this day still help me keep going on a daily basis. That even if my family didn’t care and I really didn’t have any friends to turn to, there are still people out there that care about me despite barely knowing me.\n\nThe next day my mother tried to make me take it again and I told her that i would end my life if she made me take it again.

Just try something, even if it’s a collage or fanfiction or stick figures or simple garage band beat, idk, even a puzzle or that “adult drawing book” where you just paint pictures how you like it. If you have any will to do anything (because suicide is a big action and people who try to commit it not the ones who have no will to do anything, it’s usually more active people who have or gained some strength, but were in the bad place for a long time — so it’s important to give this strength a positive momentum).\nAnd the 3d thing that helped is my will to get better, so I went to doctor (private one, because in my country it’s very stigmatised to have any psychological problems) and got a prescription, and logged everything I felt in the journal so I could detect if the pills are helping or not and actively communicated with doctor about side effects and my thoughts about it.\nThis was my approach and it helped a lot to get out of this horrible state. I stopped taking pills this summer and I’m in remission. But ofc I weren’t always this collected and determined to improve my state, I went a long long way of neglecting my state and worsen it to the point I couldn’t think of anything but suicide even though I had nice job and relationship. I did everything wrong and then I tried to do it right. It worked. That means other depressed suicidal people can do it too.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 763, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

To give in to some social pressure, to not die valiantly or in a battle or helping others, to never achieve anything in my life just because I was *sad*...

So when death does come, it will provide me with a moments rest. I'm not sure if there's anything I can offer to console my fellows who are also despairing in these times.

Unfortunately for me when I got close to death but realized I didn't want anything to do with it, my mind switched to another escape and for about 2 months I became sort of delirious, and very deep in my daydreams. But a group of girls from my class (I was in high school) insisted to stay with me, because they knew avout my struggles, and they were my gate to entering the real world again. In the frightening chaos that was the world, from which I so desperately wanted to run, they lend me their hands and created a space of comfort for me to step in. It wasn't much but it was enough.\n\nIt took me 2 more years before I understood what my place in all this is, and how to be more brave and responsible.

Find them and tackle them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are some cancerous energy draining activities that give us a temporary \"high\" but leave us too tired to do anything productve (see the above point) They also (later) bring about feelings of worthlessness which makes you turn to them again to get another \"high\" It could be anything from alcohol to porn addictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise is really helpful.

{"article": "First time commenter here. Sorry this is long and rambling but it feels good to get this off my chest. I’ve never told anyone before.\n\n I grew up in a very abusive home and have been a lifelong stammerer, this combination had me suicidal since the age of 15, it actually gave me some comfort when I would lie awake at night, listening to the abuse going on in my home, that I could leave Earth when I wanted. Time went on and eventually my parents had a sudden and messy split, they never officially divorced, my dad moved into a tent, and then found another woman etc., and mom became an alcoholic. I went my own way, couchsurfing with family for a time before I eventually felt like a useless burden and decided the time was coming for me to take my own life. But before I did, I told myself I would fulfil a few of my dreams. \n\nI always wanted to see the USA, and so I worked hard at a local brewery, saved some money, booked myself a flight and left one night. In the US I befriended a family and they somewhat took me under their wing, allowing me to stay at their house and the father would show me around the area I was staying and it really felt like I was living the American teenage years I had always daydreamed about. \n\nsome time went on, I went back to the UK and couchsurfed a little longer with family and again planned a return to the US, to see the same family and do it again, but this time I got a visa so I could save up more money and stay longer. The time came around and during my time there the father confesses his love for me in private. It was a strange time, he was a married man of 40 years and I am a straight male, 18/19 at the time. It got weird fast and I had to leave again, so just like before I packed my bags and left in the night. This time getting a Greyhound to New York City. Some kind of vagabond adventure where no one knew where I was.\n\nIt took some time to get there and while travelling I managed to find a host to stay with in return for cash. A pretty successful actor, I thought he seemed cool and somewhat of a brotherly figure. Alas, it didn’t go well and he assaulted me a few weeks into my stay. Again, I left, but this time back to the UK for good, where I knew for sure it was time to go. And so I booked a one way ticket to a different city, along with a one night stay in a hotel room where on my 22nd birthday I attempted to take my own life by h*ng*ng. Obviously, it was unsuccessful - and embarrassing. I had actually spent my last $ on the room and so the following morning I was alone, ashamed in a city I didn’t know with nowhere to stay and not knowing what to do, I called my sister and explained what happened, and she bought me a ticket home and gave me somewhere to stay for a couple weeks.\n\nI eventually moved back in with my mother who had deteriorated greatly, but I saw this is a chance to help her get better. I also joined Tinder around the same time. In an attempt to feel normal again, I went on a date with a girl at a nearby bar. We truly fell in love and after a few weeks discovered that our paths were eerily similar. Distant father, alcoholic mother etc.\n\nMy mother passed away at the end of last year, but me and my girlfriend moved in together and are still going strong today. I can honestly say I don’t know where I would be without her, but I don’t think it would be good. I still don’t have a dime to my name and the past still hurts me but after so many years of struggle and immense pain, all it took was one lucky swipe on an app for me. I’m not suicidal anymore.

{"article": "I have four really distinct moments that kept me going long enough to get the help I needed.\n\nThe first one was when I was about 14 or so. One of my childhood best friends and I had reconnected within the last couple of years thanks to Facebook, and we were hanging out because he \"Just felt like I needed some time out of the house.\" He played his guitar and sang Nickleback songs like we use to do when we were little. I had been suicidal for the last couple of weeks because the abuse I went through from an older ex boyfriend was finally kicking in to effect. He reminded me that people loved me, and it kept me going.\n\nAt 16, my girlfriend of 3 almost 4 years at the time and I had recently split and I was being harassed by prior abusive ex boyfriend and my home life was miserable. Ex-girlfriend said she would never take me back if I slept with someone else (Was a virgin still). She had never really liked my childhood best friend, and he was the poster child of a horn dog so I decided to be petty. Afterwards, he held me close and hummed \"The Middle\" from Jimmy Eats World. I ended up just putting that song on every time I felt like I couldn't go on.\n\nAt 19 I had three OD attempts within the span of a month after moving across the country with my boyfriend. The last one landed me on a ventilator for 24 hours, and it's nothing short of a miracle that I not only survived but came out pretty much unscathed by it. (I had been without oxygen for a bit of time, and had severe disruptions in my heart rhythm.) I found out a week later a close friend had succeeded in his attempt less than a day after I was released from the hospital. From that point on I decided I needed to live for him, because his time on earth was cut short and it wasn't fair.\n\nFrom that point till this year I have done very well with not only managing my mental health issues, but improving it to the point I no longer need psychiatric medication other than a sleep aid here and there or an ativan if my anxiety gets way too out of control. \n\nHowever in February of this year I buried my childhood best friend who had helped me so much more than he knew. The last time I saw him in person was the last time we had slept together before I started dating my current boyfriend, and while it is a beautiful last memory to have with someone who meant so much to me, it hurts still that it was 8 years before the next time I saw him- which was at his viewing this year. I didn't get fully suicidal really, just a general wishing of not existing without him here. Every time we talked, it was always planning on him meeting my boyfriend and how excited he was to meet him because \"If anyone can make you smile like that, it's someone I want to thank.\" What's getting me through is knowing he'd absolutely kick my ass back to life if we met in the afterlife so soon. Our last conversation was us talking about my current health issues, and how I better not die any time soon or he'd make me regret it. But I know even if no one else believes in me, he does, and I'll come out on the other side of this better than I was before.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 815, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

Because even though everything still feels off and a bit dreary at times, I also feel really good about life too.\nAn odd exercise that I did with myself is that I sat down and pictured death truly being the end, and tried to grasp that idea. I wrote down what I would miss most about living. The list felt intimate and enlightening because oddly enough, my suffering and pain made it there. I'd miss feeling the way my skin prickedd and teeth buzzed when I'd sink into a depressed state. I'd miss how hot and choked up I'd get when I felt like exploding into a million pieces. And that's when I recognized that my struggle was beautiful as well, because life isn't just good. It's also bad. An even balance of things. It was a Zen moment for me and I came to peace about death even. I wasn't scared anymore.

It will be hard, and it will suck. But if you can count on yourself and manage to drag yourself out however hard it may be- it will change everything. \n\n*on a personal note. It did get better.

{"article": "Three main reasons.\n\nThe first: I realised, that suicide would be far worse than living a life of pain. Suicide is very selfish. In ending your own suffering, you put it on others like family and friends. This suffering isn't spread equally. It rather multiplies, and each person will fell the same pain as you did, which ultimately pushes you over the edge. You never know, and never will know how others may react to your death. Some may even feel guilt for not doing more to help you.\n\nThe second: I am rather young (18), but I am very mature for my age. Growing up in a foreign country with several medical conditions and being bullied in school, life wasn't kind to me. Despite my young age, I believe I found a purpose. This is the one thing that can probably save most suicidal people. Having a purpose. If there is nothing and no-one left to live for, then make it your goal, so that others can live happy and not have to experience the same pain as you do.\n\nThe third: I no longer fear death. I have rested my mind at the inevitability of death and that we don't know when it may come. This year has really opened my kind to that and this third reason only solidified my will to live. It mostly came through music, which is one of the few enjoyments I have at the moment. Live your life, and do so by your own beliefs and standards. Don't give in to social norms, don't care for other's opinions of you, just be you and live on. \nThis realisation about life came from two main artists: Woods of Ypres and JME. Metal and grime, weird taste in music, I know. The main quote that turned on that lightbulb above my head was \"Give me enough time, and I'll find this state of mind/ \nI ain't afraid to die/ Where was I before '85?\"", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 829, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": "Knowing that it’s an option. \n\nI think about suicide a lot; I even had a kit prepared and a date set at one point. \n\nFirstly I should add that I don’t think anybody has the right to judge someone for taking their own life. Nor do I think it is immoral or the “easy way out”. Suicide can be a totally rational act, albeit it tends to be committed during a time of acute emotional stress. \n\nAnyway, I struggled with the absurdity of life for a very long time (to try to find meaning in something that is inherently meaningless). I also had a particularly rough couple of years where things seemed to be going wrong which left me undermined as a person. \n\nI realised that I have bad days and I have better days. Generally speaking the bad outweigh the good, but there is usually some happiness that will creep back into your life at some point. But I take solace in knowing that if it ever does get unmanageably awful there is always a way out that will make it end. It’s a very permanent solution, but at there is always a “cure”.

{"article": "Wow a lot of these have deep backstories \nBut for me\nIt was my boyfriend\nSee, before him, I was in a really r e a l l y bad fucking place. I was sexually assaulted by my step dad when I was younger, and I haven’t told a soul. He still lives with us. He still gives me the side eye, checking me out. He used to rub himself up against me when I was younger pretending it was an accident. I felt like I had no one to talk to. I couldn’t tell my mother, me and her already have an estranged relationship. I’m still young, sixteen in fact, and I was afraid of the chaos my family would be interrupted into if I told anyone. My older brother would kill him...literally. So would my mom, but I’m not so much worried about her as I am about my brothers. They’re so young, and I’m scared of them witnessing and going through such a thing as young as they are. I was living in constant fear and disgust, with myself and him. I would shrink into myself whenever he would walk by. I always wear baggy clothes because I don’t want his gaze to linger too long on me. I want to dress my age, I want to feel confident. But with him around, I just can’t. Everything in me is crushed. My self esteem, my body image, my mentality. He still hasn’t stopped with the leering or disgusting looks. So every day since the incident, I was always spiraling. Slowly at first, not really registering what happened and why. But this year...this year I was out of control. My thought started circling around suicide, how sharp a knife would feel on my skin. But I never cut. And the only reason why I didn’t...is because my mother had told me that I “would get my ass beat if I ever cut”. I love my mother, but she’s always putting me in a cycle of manipulation. I’m not even sure if I love her. Our relationship is based off of fear. I believe in disciplining your kids but with her. It was borderline abuse. One time I was utterly exhausted, I just wanted to go to my room and sleep. My thought were getting out of order and I needed to regroup myself, to try to hide it again. So when she asked me to do something for her, I told her I just wanted to go to sleep. She called me over again and I replied saying “hold on let me just change and I’ll come back down”. I have no idea what I said wrong, if it was my tone or my body language, but the next thing i know im on the floor. She yanked my hair back and started slapping me. She then threw me down and started kicking me. My own mother. The one person I’m supposed to love and trust. It’s been like that throughout my whole childhood. My fear of both of them paralyzing me and refraining me from speaking. So earlier this year I was walking home from school and  just...I couldn’t do it. I went to the nearest park and sat under the jungle gym and cried. I didn’t want to go home. My mind at that point had figured that my family wouldn’t be affected if I was gone. No one would. I’m very introverted so I don’t have any friends. Yes I do well in school, but I always am hard on myself and get stressed too easily and just breakdown. I thought I was useless. And as I started to calm down, I noticed a guy sitting on the swing set, staring at me. I froze, feeling ashamed and embarrassed, and I started cleaning myself up and got ready to head home. As I started to walk away, he ran up to me and asked if I was alright. I stared at him...and completely lost it. I started crying, sobbing. And he looked at me with understanding. I know this sounds fake but I swear on my life, at that moment, he understood me. So he grabbed me and hugged me. And from then on we’ve always been talking. He’s given me hope every single day. I told him about everything, my mom and her husband. And we made a promise. As soon as I turn eighteen, I can find a safe place to stay. My own safe haven. My mental health has gotten better. He’s always by my side. Treats me like a fucking queen. He also had issues, and sometimes breaks down. But we help each other on the way. We were both suicidal in the beginning, but we’ve helped each other. He got me out of my smoking habit. I used to smoke weed since I was fourteen. And every day I’m grateful for him. Every day I pray that we stay together always. And even if that doesn’t happen, I’ll be strong enough by them to handle it. Thank you reddit for allowing me to vent.

{"article": "So this will probably get lost in the comments and the formatting is ass cause mobile but,\n\nIn 2017 my best friend was murdered in our apartment. I was at an all time low and had recently nearly committed suicide. What stopped me a few months before he was killed was that he was in his room 10ft away. Then after I kind of coasted and had a lot of support from friends. Well 5 months later one of my friends that helped me process my best friends murder and begin moving past it was killed in a car accident. Needless to say 2017 wasn't my year. But it gets worse. January of 2018 my girlfriend of 3 years left me after admitting to cheating on me for 6 months and saying \"I haven't been in love with you for months but didn't think it was a good time to leave since (my friends) were killed. \n\nSo what keeps me alive is that my best friends that are both gone now always had faith in me. Two people who knew me better than anyone. They knew I was capable of greatness. I promised them I wouldn't give up and I would continue pushing forward and healing. \n\nIts been 3.5 years now. After the breakup I moved out of my home town, started a new job, had some ups and downs for sure, some failed relationships etc. \n\nI make decent money, I live in a nice home, I own a car I've always wanted, and I've been in a healthy relationship with a woman that loves me and has helped me heal from past trauma.

{"article": "I went to a childish gambino concert and saw how beautiful life really is. I (24m) was diagnosed with panic disorder and depression when i was 18 years old but i had definitely been dealing with it way before that. There were points where I couldn’t even leave my driveway without having a panic attack and long periods of time when I couldn’t leave the house. In 2018 THATS when i was at my lowest. I had quit my job, I wasn’t working, i couldn’t leave the house, and i saw no point in trying anymore. Like a lot of others I’m the type to plan events a few months in advance to keep myself going so I have something to look forward to. I bought the tickets for myself in February for the concert in September. I’ve been to a lot of concerts and was kinda losing interest in everything as it got closer so I told myself that the childish gambino show would be my last and after that I wasn’t going to plan any more events because I was done with life. September came around and it was 2 days before the show and it was announced that childish gambino broke his leg at the tour stop before I was supposed to see him so they would have to postpone the show until he healed up. I truly think that’s the reason that I’m still here and maybe that’s an ego thing but idk. The new show date was in December so I had to hold on until then. I fought through some dark times but I knew I had to see my favorite artist before I left this realm. I went to the show and I sat 5th row and for the first time in a very long time I felt something other than depression and anxiety. I felt like I belonged to something I felt like I belonged somewhere. I was able to smile and dance and sing along to my favorite songs. Donald Glover saved my life that night and ever since then I’ve been on an active journey to heal and get better. I still have my dark days and my depression and anxiety can get the best of me but I’m in a place where I can manage it and get things done.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 843, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": "Reading old Philosophy. Plenty of people have reflected have on heavy stuf throughout history. By reading or listening to their reflections I obtained an ability to find optimistic thinking through reason instead of faith (which of I had none). I realized that even many seemingly modern problems have been present I society for a very long time, and that the sum of all societies problem probably is smaller now than ever before. It also made me feel better grounded in my decision making, knowing I had learned to evaluate from more perspectives than before. It helped me realize that my anxiety was a tool that could be utilized for good. It had convinced me that most positive development comes from the most negative experiences, and I still believe that. I was suicidal for ~20% of my life at the turning point, after which I recovered incredibly fast. \n\nAnother thing that helped me: creating \"manifests\" and  monologs. Meaning I wrote down or recorded stuff I disliked and proposed how it could be done better. It made my opinions and thoughts more tangible. Unabstracted in my head, they caused me a lot of nuisance and anxiety. Like a constant feeling of something being very wrong but not having a clue about what is wrong. The very act of selecting words to describe what I felt was wrong, often surfaced very valuable insight from my subconscious. I never planned to release any document and never did. I showed some things to few friends for feedback and relief sharing. \n\nFor a long time, I knew nothing but darkness and chaos. Which is how I have learned to tame it. I would never wish my depression undone. I hated to have it, but love to have had it. Just like school (for me). Losing fear of death and learning to be observant on hardships (knowing there will come a lesson sooner or later) made my mind stronger than ever. \n\nI know I'm gonna be swung back down in the abyss now and then, but it's creatures can't hurt me as they did.

{"article": "Former  nearly attempted person here, I was going through the times of clinical depression when I was first time suicidal. Randomly a friend of mine invited me to his student house in a different city than I was living. We did nothing special, I met a friend of him, she was nothing special or I didn't like her in a \"like\" way but there I was dealing with my suicidal thoughts whereas this girl was living her life defying rules we were all thinking ironclad whereas I was trapped on my thoughts. It was the first time I've realized there is a world outside than I can see. I've never saw neither my friend or that girl ever in my life again.\n\nThroughout the time I was going in between, and on the verge of suicidal thoughts, wrote a letter to all my loved ones. Sent my parents away from home with an excuse that night I was suppose to be alone, and i decided to go with pills. (I had a way to ensure its success but I will never disclose it so don't even try to message me about it) there it was that way my day. But as soon as I took the bottle in my hand, I took a handful in my hand and I was looking into the mirror. I thought about my mother and sister, how will they feel, how could they live without me; even if my initial thinking is \"they will forget about it in couple of years at top, like all my friends; the world is a better place without me anyway\" but than I decided I couldn't do this to them. If not for myself for them I have had to keep going. But the feeling of disappearing never fade away. I needed to make it look like natural, so I started on drinking and smoking. Oh boy! I've drank a lot, and smoked much more than that there were times when I wasnt thinking about it but in general it was always in my mind. This lasted for 9 years, in the meantime just smoking cigs wasn't enough so I started on weed as well. I am not a believer but I even prayed got to take my life away nearly every night (desperate times require desperate measures). In my darkest times, it was my cat who saved me to find joy in my life; a reason to keep going, a soul that is waiting for me to come home every day. For her I was everything, whenever something bad happened she would have come next to me or just lay on top of me and started purring. At those times I wasn't caring even if the world would have end up in flames (I guess the username also gives a hint too). Throughout endless discussions with myself, now here I am at the age of 29 and couple of weeks ago something snapped in my head, I am no longer depressed and I dont want neither to drink nor abuse any drugs, decided to live healthier and do sports as well. I've quit on drinking, and smoking weed. Since than I had 2 panic attacks, 4 EKGs, still dealing with palpitations, sweating cold hands, dizzy feeling, sometimes even feeling like drowning. Having chest pain, sometimes shortness of breath. (Nope, I've got tested I dont have COVID)  I am visiting my doctor for numerous different things for me I am feeling like I am dying whereas for everyone else \"it is just an anxiety\", I hope they are right. But I will soldier it down! There is no turning back. If you are dealing with those kind of thoughts; I know it sounds like a \"big fat joke, people doesnt understand (they have no idea), you feel like drowning on a swamp and no matter how much you are trying to save yourself you feel like going down\" and I know this will sound like the most cheesy cliche but time is the medicine for everything. I dont know your demons but believe me; everything starts and ends with you and without you none of these things matter. \n\nNow I genuinely fear for my life, for the first time in my life I wish to live yet another day; but at the age of 29, I have to live like a vegetable because whenever I try to do something sporty my heart is giving alarm signals, whereas I have to endure liver damage.

{"article": "   Back in highschool my best friend (I'll call Mr. R) and I had a falling out due to swapping girlfriends. I dated gf A and then switched to gf B while he vice versa.  A couple years later I saw a post on Facebook from gf A about a memorial for those who knew Mr. R. The post was dated 3 months before I had seen it. Very little info was available. When looking into it to see what had happened, all I could find was his obituary which consisted entirely of \"Mr. R was born in *city*. Mr. R died on November in *same f*\"king city*.\" And that was it. From my perspective the dude fell off the face of the earth and had barley even existed. I had my suspicions but it wasn't until years later that gf A confirmed that he had committed suicide. \n   The worst part is that since gf B and I had the falling out with him; we both felt nothing. He'd faded away and his death changed nothing. Upon reflection it feels so meaningless. From then on every time my own suicidal thoughts would creep up my mind, I would think back to him. I'd remember the pointlessness, how it took months to even figure out it had happen, and how embarrassed those involved felt that they weren't able to help so no one mentioned him often or how he went out - leading to basically tossing the memory of him out the door. \n   I made a promise to myself from then on. No matter the pain, the sorrow, the heartbreak I will carry on. I will not fade into nothingness until the universe demands it. I refuse to die. It is due to this promise to myself that I'm alive today.\n  Those who take their own lives are usually called selfish. I'll refute that and say that if you want to take your own life for the \"I told you I was in pain, this'll show you\" factor, it doesn't work. Those close will feel pain that fades and the most others will not care. I'd argue that anyone with suicidal thoughts should be more selfish and make themselves a promise to hold above all else. Promise yourself to achieve a single great goal. Promise yourself to see it through the end. Promise yourself to be your own record of your life because not always does someone do that for you. Promise yourself to live. Hold it above all else.\n\n   I'd like to add that this is a very brief overview of my thoughts and it is difficult to put this into words. Not everyone will benefit from this mindset . I implore anyone struggling to seek help.

{"article": "I've talked about it before I believe once or twice on here but I cannot remember. It requires a bit of a backstory so dig in.\n\nThe one thing that kept me going through my darkest times arrived unexpectedly in my life all because two friends were worried about me; my girlfriend and I had broken up the day before Halloween after I had rode the bus back to my home town from college to see her and to go to a Halloween party with her and our two mutual friends; anyways on the way to her grandma's house she ended things. I was confused, annoyed, and a bit bummed out as I had seen our life going somewhere but much like most high school loves it wasn't meant to be. So there I was in my old town with no car, and now nowhere to sleep for the week I had arranged to be down there with her. Those two friends I had mentioned before invited me over and that gesture helped me quite a bit though it isn't what ultimately saved me from myself; it was just the start of a beautiful friendship that still persists to this day.\n\nI ended up spending all weekend there at their place, we got drunk on absinthe and went and got tattoos. Ended up going home at the end of my stay to an apartment that my ex and I had decorated together as we had planned for her to move in with me for school as well; but now it wasn't even really my apartment. I could still smell her everywhere and it drove me into a dark spiral. Grades started slipping, mood shifted, I was skipping classes to escape into a world of videogames. Spending money like I just didn't care and more or less I had given up at that point on my passions and dreams. My two friends noticed my mood had drastically changed so they mentioned someones cat just had kittens and I could have one if there was one I wanted, and they sent a picture to me. There was the dorkiest looking black and white cow splotched cat and I loved him.\n\nHe was what kept me going for the longest times, he helped me through that first truly dark period of my life because I had this small little kitten to take care of. He slept on my chest or back at night, would never be far from me in the dark; would love on me when I was feeling down. Little spitfire of a butthead at times, but he was my little guiding light through the storms of my mind.\n\nAnyways that is how Raize came into my life; it was only about five or six years ago now where I had another severe break up. Had a bad day at work on top of it; and it just felt like everything was going wrong and it would just be easier to end everything, to stop the immense and immeasurable pain I was feeling. I had moved states less than a year before this; and my only friend at the time was my now ex that just left me. All my family lives fairly close, and I stay with my mom at present (especially thankful that I am now with COVID going on in the world.)  But mentally I felt extremely alone and isolated with nobody. I walked into the house to retrieve my handgun, and saw my dear boy Raize sitting there, and he meowed at me before coming to me and doing as most cats do and rubbed against my leg but my mind was gone at that point the only thoughts were to end everything.\n\nI had my gun with me as I sat in my bathroom, sobbing my eyes out just trying to build up the courage I felt I needed to turn everything off for good, and that butthead was meowing incessantly at my bathroom door and clawing at it. I don't really know what happened between that moment and the next, all I remember was texting my mom that she needed to get home; and to take me to the hospital immediately. I ended up spending five days in a psych ward.\n\nI gained so much knowledge while there on how to better cope with my depression, my anxieties, and paranoias. My dad who I had rarely spoken to growing up as he was emotionally distant called almost every day to see how I was doing and to just talk for a few minutes when I could, or when they would let me. My mom visited as often as she could. She was in the office with me when I was asked if I had plans on harming myself and what they were. I saw the pain in her eyes when she heard me tell the nurse how I was planning to end everything, every plan I had from shooting myself, to hanging myself in a secluded wooded area, and so forth. I regret that she had to hear me say those things; but she accepted that I needed the help and was there for me through it all.\n\nSadly I had to let my dear Raize down a year ago, he had pretty severe cancer that the little butthead hid from us more or less. He was perfectly spitfirey one day and the next I noticed he wasn't himself. It still hurts that I've lost him, and I still miss him. But without him I know that I wouldn't be here today.

{"article": "My approach has been to realize life is relatively short anyway even though it may seem long and you can eventually find the comfort in the things you do enjoy. Yes its suffering to know you may not be able to get out of a hated job, or be with your soul mate (my problem.\n\nDay by day I think of what I enjoy and I do it, I cut down on my hours if I hate work (now I do one day a week!, or rather, no days during the crisis due to shielding) and enjoy watching my favorite DnD stream (High rollers) every lunch time, I have nice food, I play video games which helps my mind wander away from the \"real\" and I meet a friend a couple days a week.   \n\n\nI avoid looking to the future, and if I do, I think to myself I could die through sheer coincidence or chance just crossing the road, or get a terminal illness (which I can refuse to treat) which will take me out of the world without me having to stress or worry. Life is unpredictable and does not last.   So just try and enjoy what you like in the mean time.   \n\n\nNever care, never cry, I think that is a good motto.  Also, I found writing suicide notes a way to relieve stress and although I never did self harm, I had contingencies that I could rely upon to shuffle off this mortal coil if things got too heavy, which ironically made me feel empowered and in control, which kept be going a bit longer.   \n\n\nFeeling trapped I think is the worse thing, just like when on a life raft or aircraft, they say keep aware of the exits on the vehicle at all times in case things go wrong, life is no different, consider an escape, but try and hold on for as long as possible, the turbulence may pass.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 859, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": "For me, it was a combo of a few things. \n\nOne of the biggest contributors was getting a new job that I felt I earned and increasing the worth I badly needed. I needed a change of surroundings that would allow me some peace. \n\nI also had reached out to a few people around me (mainly coworkers) who I valued and respected greatly. If these people who are so admired and revered by others take time out of their schedule to hang out with me, it shifted my mindset from being a burden to seeing them as the support system that got me through the darkest point in my life mentally. Being available and supportive of those going through a hard time, within reason, will not go unnoticed. \n\nIf you don’t feel comfortable meeting new people, try counseling. There is no shame going to someone for advice. Many counselors do pay based on a sliding scale- you pay what you can. It’s better to get your emotions and thoughts out than contain them. \n\nThe last thing that helped was being able to help me disconnect from the sources of my tendencies in the first. I know not everyone can do this. I was just lucky enough to pull myself out of the situation without feeling I owed an explanation or looking back. I have never experienced suicidal tendencies until I dealt with a set of traumatic experiences and a lot of painful changes due to what happened. My life as I knew it needed to fully change and it took a lot of time to grieve what I lost. What really set up the onset of suicidal tendencies for me was not the trauma, but rather the lack of support I got from my garbage “friends” and emotionally abusive ex-boyfriend who tore me down at every given opportunity. This was because of his unresolved negative feelings towards me that emerged post-breakup beneath the guise of “trying to build a friendship”. Get people like that out of your life. You will be better off alone trying to fix your thoughts and working to have a more positive self-view rather than have people constantly lie and gaslight you so you look to them for your value rather than ignoring their noise and looking to yourself.\n\nLast tip: When I say this, it does not mean you cannot be depressed/suicidal and date or be involved with other. But, do NOT look to other people to fix you and help you develop beyond your tendencies and the other issues you have going on. Escapism was how I dealt with a low self-esteem and I ended up with a lot more baggage to sift through. Relationships are great for occupying your time and not feeling lonely. They may work for some, but if my story resonates with you- I recommend that you take some time to develop yourself and your character so you don’t have the same boundary and validation struggles I did. \n\nI hope this helps someone out in the way I once needed it.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 860, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "Humans generally assume different roles depending on their environments. For instance, a mother with a career would behave differently at a professional setting versus a family setting. Similar to others without the disorder, people with Disassociative Identity Disorder (DID) have parts that would assume certain roles in their lives. If the mother is diagnosed with DID, she may have a part “Alice” that is career oriented and would most of the time take care of all work related tasks, and another part “Beth” that is motherly when at home. The main difference is the parts are disassociated from each other such that they have their own memories and personalities so each part may not have shared access to the memory of the others. In terms of external appearance, it would often hard to tell of someone has a DID or not if you did not already know that they have it. While this disorder often causes many life challenges, many have adapted, and there are many high functioning people that are diagnosed with DID.

My dad even found it in himself to realise it was no longer the right time to make those silly funny put you down dad jokes.\n\nThey became my true best friends, went above and beyond in so many ways. Rescued me in the middle of the night when I did stupid things and really fucked up. They never gave up.\n\nCame a point when I realised, there was no way I could possibly kill myself because it would literally devastate and destroy them. I couldn't do that to them. I held my head up a little higher, tried a little harder every day but still didn't want to be on this earth, so I decided I would just wait until they died then I would do it.\n\nSlowly as time went on, I realised there was something more than that, as they get older. I want to be around so when they become frail and old, I want to be the person that is there for them, not just because I deeply feel I owe them so much  but because I want to be the one that will care for them when they need it most, just like they always have for them.\n\nThat made me realise that even when they go, I can't kill myself, it would be a disrespect to everything they have done and it's a **lot**. I have to try to be the best person I can be, even when they are gone, to honour their memory.\n\nSince that realisation, I'm trying a little harder every single day. I'm not the best person I can be, I doubt I ever will be but I will damn well continue trying and trying and trying and maybe that *is* the best person I can be, a little step at a time, every single day, I'll try to make more of my life.

{"article": "Two words. \"Die tomorrow.\" \n\nNo matter how things get in the now, there's no rush. Get to the end of the day and go to sleep. If you wake up feeling the same, you can always die tomorrow. One thing I've learned from struggling with suicide is that it's not actually something I want, but it IS something I can be confronted with from time to time. \n\nGetting to the end of the day will force you to confront the root cause of your feelings, and often force you to face the truth of how your actions would affect those around you. Often times, this perspective, the realization of how you would want to explain your situation to those you care about, to keep them from blaming themselves, is in itself enough to contextualize your mental state within the bigger picture. Furthermore, being trapped in that mental flatspin is fucking exhausting. It burns an incredible amount of energy, and often exacerbates the chemical imbalances that may have put you into that mindset in the first place. Getting some sleep can do wonders for helping to pull you out of it and give you the energy to face your situation in earnest. \n\nDealing with death is no different than dealing with life—you don't have to solve everything at once, or even at all—just do what you can today and reassess tomorrow. \n\nIn twenty years of struggling with suicide, I've only woken up to the same feelings I went to bed with once. \n\nObviously I'm not a mental health professional, my words aren't gospel, everyone has different coping mechanisms, and everyone responds to situations differently, but in the off chance that this helps someone make it to tomorrow, I wanted to be honest, as it also forces me to accept that I often need help myself. \n\nOn a personal level, learning to identify the mental patterns, the irrationality, mood swings, emotional black holes, lethargy, disconnection, frustration with beloved activities and hobbies, inability to verbally communicate, distrust, jealousy, anxiety, and all the other micro-variances in my personality that are warning signs in advance of things spiraling out of control has been a big part of my learning to cope and address problems before they arise with injections of exercise, sunlight (or vitamin D rich foods), electrolytes and mineral salts, as well as nutrient-dense foods and reaching out to those around me to explain the fact that I'm struggling and have identified a situation I need to safeguard against has been a major step towards preventing these situations from derailing my life the way they used to. I suppose that really comes down to honesty—both with others and myself that this is something I can't just will away or ignore, and that while I may be defective, it's the flaws that highlight our beauty—it's part of who I am, but I don't let it define me. \n\nI don't know what more I can say other than that I hope this can help someone.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 895, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "I don't think I'll ever truly recover from that one dark time in my life. I have had many dark times, but this particular event just felt like the straw that broke the camel's back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter graduating from college, I decided that I wanted to go to law school. I wanted to be a lawyer, but I was anxious and afraid about how my disability would impact me in getting my doctorate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents were convinced that law was a disability friendly job-field and it seemed to pair well with my college studies. I couldn't be a cop and working in a correctional facility was out of the question. My college professors begged me to continue my studies at the master's level. Still, I was able to get good recommendations and I spent months studying for the LSAT completely on my own. I was able to raise my original test score (that I had taken cold without any test prep whatsoever) by a decent amount. My LSAT and college GPA got me into a few law schools and I had at least 1  partial scholarship opportunity. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, my disability makes it hard to do things on my own and my parents really wanted me to live at home. I got waitlisted to this private, but more established law school. However, the price tag was just too much to ask my parents and sister to cover. So, I applied for this other school where I could get my degree and still live relatively close to home despite a 2 hour commute each way. I'll just call my school Law School X. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided that I was going to be upfront about my disability and I openly disclosed it to admissions officers. I talked about my desire to help people with disabilities in all of my written essays and I cited my college advocacy in my intent. I attended every recruitment session for all of my city's law schools. Law school X accepted me and I accepted right away. In hindsight, I should have waited to hear back from all the schools I applied to but, I didn't. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLaw School X hosted a prospective event that I attended, where I expressed my concerns about exceling in law school with a disability. My family and I were reassured when the Dean said that no matter where I decided to go, any law school would be able to work with me. (Side note: it's federal law). The time came to sign my enrollment papers and I was so excited. Unfortunately, everything went downhill from that point forward. I didn't get the help and support my school had promised to provide me and my grades suffered as a result. I was placed on academic probation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring my academic probationary period, a law school staff member encouraged me to drop out. He said that \"the hill was too steep to climb\" and that no student in all of his higher education experience had ever made it back into good standing with the kind of GPA I had. I wasn't the only person on probation, in fact,  at least half of my law school class was under the good standing threshold. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLaw School X knew that the major oversight body was due to audit them and offered a further incentive: drop out and I would get half of my tuition back in \"voluntarily\" leaving the school. I became extremely sick as a result of countless nights not sleeping and suffering  though a toxic environment.  ( professors and my fellow classmates).  I wasn't eating and I got so stressed out that  I \\*forgot\\* Dad's birthday entirely. I would stay up into the early morning hours and was getting anywhere from 2-3 hours of sleep per night. All of this was made worse when I caught a bad stomach bug that left me in the hospital for 5 days. My doctor said that I was suffering from stress and exhaustion. Looking back now, it's crazy to think about the stress and paranoia I was under. I can still remember doing work while laying in my hospital bed. I was given drugs to help me sleep and to be honest those 5 days are a bit blurry.  Law school X constantly emailed and phoned home for me even after being told I was in the hospital. They wanted to know about my decision to sign the drop out paperwork. (My mom took over because I was so sick.)\n\nI ended up getting academically dismissed from school despite everything that happened and I made the tough decision to file a civil rights complaint.  When the oversight body came to do their visit, I gave them all of the documentation I gave to the civil rights office. The oversight body released a report that made my circumstances known to everyone, including my classmates. My classmates began harassing me and I was ostracized for blowing the whistle. I still didn't know if my complaint was going to be validated: if not, I was gonna be branded the complainer that people thought I was. \n\nEven with an active complaint against the school, a teacher decided to publicly out which accommodations I was getting to a group of students. I had to find out about the incident when several students told me about it.  My humiliation further grew when that same teacher threatened to report me to the displinary committee over bogus plagiarism accusations.  I knew that it was all because of my decision to become a whistle-blower. I was devastated and seriously thinking about ending my life. Everything just felt like too much and I was struggling just to continue. I decided that I would try to transfer elsewhere, but not one professor was willing to write me a recommendation letter to do so, and the schools I tried to transfer to wouldn't waive the requirement. They knew about the report and said that I was among a herd of students trying to leave Law School X. My family had to hire a lawyer during this time because my status as a academically dismissed student meant that I couldn't transfer -- It was a Scarlett Letter. \n\n I felt trapped and I lost a year or more desperate to figure out how I was going to continue to get back in while I awaited to hear the outcome of my civil rights complaint.  The investigation  found that the law school had discriminated against me because of my disability and changes were made to ensure that what happened to me didn't happen again. The resolution process allowed me to avoid having to repeat all my classes and having to start over. The school never reimbursed me for anything and I still feel guilty about my mom's decision to pay for a lawyer out of her retirement. It was three years of hell and I still have residual incidents that have happened because of my civil rights complaint. \n\nI'm still here and I am glad that I am. It has not been easy, but I have seen changes being made and I did climb that hill that was too steep to climb. My life's trajectory changed significantly, but I think my experience has deeply shaped who I am. Now, I want to help other people in getting the help the need in coming forward about discrimination, harassment, and similar issues.  \n\nI am more able to recognize hostile and toxic situations in responding accordingly. \\*\\*If anyone is reading this: No matter how small a microaggression may seem PLEASE document it. \\*\\* If I didn't have the documentation that I did, I would not be a semester away from receiving my law degree. I plan to start studying for the Bar soon and hopefully I'll get my license to practice as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*TLDR: I blew the whistle on my law school's disability discrimination and paid a heavy price, but I am using this negative experience to help others and still become the lawyer I want to be. Suicide kills more than just your person-- your dreams, aspirations, and future die along with it.\\*\\*\\*", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 901, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "I remember one time I was fully ready to go, had the knife and got in my car, going to drive to the same stretch of road one of my best friends killed himself at. But I had a Spanish test, and I had studied for it so I decided I would go do my test, and then drive over since the spot wouldn't be fair from my college. One of my buds in class must have noticed I wasn't being myself and asked if I was okay. I told her I was tired but I was okay. I did the test, left the class, and for some reason I just lost my nerve. Maybe it was taking my mind off my current situation by focusing on my test or maybe it was my friend asking me how I was, but it snapped me back to reality. I'm actually coming up on my 10 year anniversary of my first suicide attempt in December. I know the date so well because it was the day after I found my mom dead; stuck a revolver in my mouth but didn't know how revolvers worked so I pointed it at my closet and pulled the trigger, and put a hole through a binder and fucked up my ears since it was a small room. 10 years and a lot of attempts, but it's been a little over 2 years since my last major run with suicidal ideation, and I even worked up the courage to buy my first firearm a month ago since I feel my certain that I don't want to eat a bullet. Don't get me wrong, those thoughts are still there, occasionally popping up when I get sad or stressed. But it's gone from  front row seats at a Motley Crue concert loud to the TV at the dentist office loud. They don't overwhelm every thought when they rear their ugly head, and it's easier to rationalize it. I think, for anyone still reading this that wants any advice, that the only thing that really helps is time. Whether you spend that time in therapy or just working and living life, your brain starts to realize it doesn't want to die so badly. But it's shitty because sometimes you can't imagine giving yourself any more time. The hurt feels so bad and overwhelming that the very idea of giving yourself a day or even an hour to think about it seems like torture. So you have to fight every impulse you have to end the suffering and buy yourself that time. Yell at yourself, slap your face like you are your own pimp, shock yourself back into some sense of rational thought to buy that time. Because if you don't, maybe there won't be a Spanish test or friend to ask how you're doing. Don't depend on someone else or something else saving you, you need to be your own advocate.

{"article": "Honestly after burying 8 of my friends and family I don't know.  Everyday I think about someone or see their faces when I sleep.  Happy dreams become nightmares when I wake up knowing I can't remember all the time spent with them there.  There are some wounds that never heal.  Some voids in your heart that can't be filled with drugs, sex, crying, or love. Everyday I'm exhausted from the moment I wake up to the point that I'm too tired and pass out.  I can't sleep because I'm afraid to see them happy or sad.  My mental health slips between anxiety or depression with feeling numb on a good day.  Movies, television, and media, can leave me broken watching someone fictional die like one of them.  I can see them laying in their caskets.  I cry thinking about them coming home like they have been gone for to long and forgot to visit.  Their ghosts haunt me through my grief and I want them to.  It's the only thing I have left to keep the void from growing.  I want it like some deranged masochist who can't let go because if it's easier than feeling like I've lost a piece of my soul.  I know there are others who have experienced loss like I have but few people I've ever met can imagine it.\n\nBut loss isn't a pissing contest.  I haven't won a prize for being more broken or more functional.  Your pain matters as much as mine, which is why I want to tell you this. If I can push through this waking nightmare, you can to.  We are all going to die someday, I won't lose what's left of my life to the loss I've already had to endure.  I can at least be patient for those who don't have the gift of life I still have left.\n\nAs a final note I want to say some good things I've gained from not killing myself. I got married to my soulmate, we bought a house, I have three amazing fur babies \"a dog and two cats\", I'm close with the living portion of my family and they love me unconditionally, I find at least one way to be happy everyday, and I'm here to tell you, you can manage this.

She came to see me for a week, then I asked her to move in with me (was renting a room then), so she could have at least safe place to sleep and eat. Hour later she show up with duffel full of her stuff.\n\nAfter couple of weeks I introduced her to my therapist (which had to wait, as experiences with one were part of her bad life), and just provided her with what I think are normal human interactions. What got to her finally, was learning that I also have my problems, quite a lot actually, and she just started caring for me too. We formed a mutual help relationship, with regular sessions with a professional mental health specialist. Half a year later we kind of agreed that living together worked out, we like each other, so we started dating, had our first kiss, then more. Aaaand I proposed to her last year. \n\nWe both need help, we both are flawed and seen shit (without doubt she was swimming in it too), so I guess the basic takeaway is that correct support group with those who understand mental problems are essential for guiding people out from desperation.\n\nSecond takeaway is that sometimes you need correct people on your path. This is super sad to me, because I know many don't meet one.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 916, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": "[Trigger warning]\n\nLong story short: Friends, therapy and the thought of hurting people I love.\n\nNow for the long version: I had always been against suicide and thoight that people that did it were \"not trying hard enough\" to get better, you know stupid ideas from someone who didn't know better, and this idea only got stronger when one of my best friends kept telling us that he wanted to die and one day we would never hear from him again then my dad, who was going through a divorce at the time, attempted it multiple times and then Chester Bennington's suicide (all of this in about 5 or 6 years not really at the same time) and actually lots of celebrities commiting suicide during that period but Chester's hit me the hardest, so this idea just kept getting stronger and stronger and not really hating on the people but more like hating the thought of them trying and I was like \"I will never try it or be depressed, I'm not like them\"\n\nFast forward a year and a half (around 2019) and multiple things were happening and it really took a toll on me, a pretty hard heartbreak, low self-esteem, leaving an organization I loved and had been part of for 4 years, hating my job, debts and money issues and well, the dark thoughts started creeping in, ever since my father's \"most effective\" attempt I tried to re-educate myself on mental health but that was a long journey that had just begun, and one of my closest friends is a psychologist and she has always thought of me as a great study subject but since she's my friend she tries not to get \"psychologist-mode\" on me, but she noticed something odd at the moment, like I said, I tried to get better and more knowledgeable on mental health and I asked her for resources and stuff, one day she told me of how I use humor as a coping mechanism and in this \"I will never commit suicide\" mindset I showed her my meme collection and she saw it and asked me how many suicide memes I had, I started counting and in about 30 minutes I got like 100-ish suicide memes so she tried to talk me into therapy. I used the usual excuses \"I don't need it\", \"they're just memes, nothing serious\", \"therapy is too expensive\" and she just gave me like the best sort of argument against my own mind, she started getting the cost of how much it would cost me going to therapy vs how much my friends and family spend if I committed suicide and it got through me, then I thought of one of Cyanide and Happiness imo best comics which I have always liked but this time I saw it in a whole new light, [this comic](http://explosm.net/comics/3996/), so I gave in and decided to give therapy a go.\n\nFirst session was free and I was on this smug-ish attitude of \"I'm doing you a favor, I don't really need it\" but oh was I wrong, I came down crying and just crumbled, I really bottled a lot of things up and I never really attempted it, thoughts would come and go but I will always thank her so so much because if I had stayed on that path, who knows how long it would have taken for thought to become attempts, around that same time I found out my little cousin had attempted it and it hit me up again, full force, I talked about it with my therapist and also with my friend of how to try and talk to him since he was keeping it a secret, he didn't want anyone to know that he had tried and made his brother and mother to keep it a secret, they told me to tread carefully and to not really do anything if I didn't feel like handling the situation because it could actually backfire horribly, thankfully it didn't, he and I have become a lot closer.\n\nAll of this was about a year and a half and I believe I have grown a lot and matured about it, a lot, I finally decided to tell my parents about this and it was a tear shedding but it felt pretty liberating, things between my father and I are way smoother, definitely have a whole new vision on life and on mental health and suicide.\n\nIf you have gone through all of this and you have thought about suicide, I don't mean to tell you all will magically fix itself but it does get better, I urge you to seek help it is not weakness it actually shows strength, it's okay to not feel okay and the brain can pull some really nasty things on you but it is not real, just hang on and I'm just a stranger on the internet but people love you, I love you and the world is better with you in it.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 917, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "For me, it was honestly video games. \n\nI know that sounds stupid, but hear me out. I was at a really dark point in my life in ninth grade. I was living with my grandma, dad, and my younger brother. I used to live with my brother, mom, and older sister, before suddenly being shipped from Colorado to California when I was almost 10. Heading into 9th grade, I found out that that reason my mom couldn't raise my brother and I anymore (my sister was already emancipated by this point) was because she had gotten hooked on meth. I honestly had spent the last 5 years just waiting for her to come back and get us so things could go \"back to normal\", so hearing that she really wasn't coming back was a massive blow to me. I felt like I didn't have either of my parents at that point because my dad was a bum who slept all day and only came out of his room at like 3 am to microwave a couple hotdogs and then go back, and now my mom was a druggie in another state and wasn't coming back for me. \n\nOn top of that, I came from a sheltered white neighborhood and was dropped smack in the middle of North Hollywood, and I wasn't even aware that other races existed at that point in my life, but was suddenly being bullied by a girl because (as she told me) \"White people are evil, and you're evil for being one.\" Which confused me for a while but as I learned about it, I started to blame myself for the things that I saw other people of my race doing, like police brutality or yelling slurs or targeting poc. The mentality that gave me was that everything was my fault, and I somehow also decided that my mom getting hooked on drugs was my fault, thinking I was probably a burden to her and she needed an escape.\n\nI was never really allowed to use technology in middle school because I was being raised by my grandma, who thought it was bad for us and didn't have the money for it, and I didn't get much of it in elementary school because the technology was also too expensive for my mom to get us. I did have a Wii, though it was technically my sister's and she only let me use it if she wanted to play bowling with me. Starting high school, though, my grandma was forced to get me a phone (albeit an obamaphone) and a laptop (of course the cheapest one she could find). They opened up a whole new world to me, especially when my boyfriend at the time bought me some games from Steam so we could play together. I remember having so much fun playing Terraria and Brawlhalla, and eventually he also got me Undertale, which I played through mostly blind and still adore to this day. The amount of games I have now is massive, but those three games in particular really pulled me through. I was seriously considering killing myself, thinking that neither of my parents wanted me and that I was a burden and evil just for existing. Playing video games brought me a lot of joy and made me hesitant to end things, and they ended up giving me a lot of good messages as well. Undertale, for example, taught me that what you are doesn't define who you are. Terraria gave me a good creative outlet because it was a sandbox game/open world. Playing Brawlhalla got me talking to new people and making new friends, which I didn't think I was able to do at that point, and most of the friends I made from playing all these different games are still my friends today, and have helped me through a lot. I've only officially gotten over the urge to end it all very recently through therapy, but gaming really kept my mind off of it and got me to make friends who would help me through it.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 924, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

Basically, there were family members very close to me whom I loved that would abuse me, and I did not see a way out, and decided that suicide was the best option (I am glad I now know it wasn't). I did have help from a friend, who got me professional help via a therapist and psychiatric help as well, which certainly lifted my spirits enough to give me the courage to get to where I am now. \n\nThe take away is that the therapist gave me a piece of wisdom I'll never forget, and that is that love and hate are very much similar things. They are both just extreme passions, but to one side or the other, and you can use them. I grew to hate the people that brought me to the point I was at, and what I did was use that hatred whenever I had a bad day.

{"article": "First, I would never describe myself as \"formerly suicidal\"—I suffer from depression and get suicidal sometimes; suicidal ideation is a  just symptom of my illness, albeit a deadly one. I expect my depression to make me feel like I am having \"dark times\" in my life every once in a while for the rest of my life. (I a fine right now, by the way.) What keeps me alive at times like that is, first of all, the certain knowledge that the feeling will pass. With that knowledge, I can talk myself out of acting on my suicidal impulse immediately. I can procrastinate, basically, knowing that the feeling will almost certainly pass. I must always make sure suicide is inconvenient to achieve, too; for example, I could never own a gun or keep one in my house. If I ever decided to shoot myself, I would first have to go shopping—and that is an obstacle, when I am depressed. Once I have decided to no act immediately I can use the time to do things  that help: sleeping and eating are the easy ones—one of those is nearly always possible when i am depressed. Sleeping all day , or eating ice cream sandwiches made from Ben &amp; Jerry's and Pop Tarts, or whatever, is easy and permitted, because hey, I may be dead tomorrow. After one of those things, I may well feel like reaching out to a good and trusted friend, or my therapist if he's available, who I know will do everything they can to help and care for and love me. By the time that is done, I am probably feel better. Maybe well enough to exercise, drink water, eat something healthier, stream a movie, whatever. And after that, the depression is usually gone. \n\nTL;DR I stay alive by procrastinating about suicide, and spend the time doing things that will gradually lift me out of my depression", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 960, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

When we got in the car to go to the ceremony. I was right besides him in the back seat and his driver turned the car on and got out to grab a backpack he forgot, but he left his gun in the cup hole that is behind the stick shift and I was looking in a different direction and all of a sudden I felt like a pain in my ear, which followed that *BEEEEEP* sound.

I didn’t want to feel or be seen as weak (which I know that committing suicide is not being weak) I confronted my dad about it and realized that as bad as it sounds It was something I needed to hear.

{"article": "Thanks for asking and engaging. I personally very specific views about self caused death.\n\nIn cases of mental illness, I believe it is always the brain suffering from some sort of imbalance, genetic predisposition, trauma that is not (or under) treated. In which case, the brain is operating under a false set of circumstances. To the afflicted, suicide is not just logical, it’s the right choice. But if the brain isn’t working the way it was intended to work then massive decisions like this cannot be made perfectly.\n\nIn cases of chronic and/or fatal illness: everyone should have the right to choose their manner of death. Take for example Cystic Fibrosis. With modern medicine, the lifelong outlook has increased significantly per the last 20 years. But there’s always a risk that the meds stop working, the disease takes over, and the person dies trying to breathe and cannot. Or, cancer patients who aren’t responding to treatment. Just a couple examples. If death is unavoidable, why shouldn’t we get to choose a peaceful, pain free method rather than “nature running its course?” In those kinds of cases I’m all for someone exerting control over their life and experiences and dying with dignity.\n\nBut in the latter, this isn’t a momentary decision brought on a mental health break. Consequences have been weighed. And the inevitable is simply that—inevitable.\n\nSuicide from mental health issues is different. And the numbers agree with me. Most people who attempt, get hospitalization, and survive, never attempt again. With one exception—guns. Pills and blades and ropes, their effects can be discovered and treated many times. But guns are damn efficient. They “get the job done”. But if people who’ve attempted really wanted to die—truly, if they did, if it wasn’t an illness lying to them—they’d have the same rate as people who attempt with firearms.\n\nFriend. This bit might be unwelcome, and I apologize if you take offense to it. But I want you to know that I’m here. If you’re struggling and simply need someone to understand your pain, I will listen. I fervently believe that the day humanity overcomes diseases like depression will lead to new, brighter, and kinder age for us all.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 966, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

I live on a small department because my parents aren't wealthy enough to buy a house or get a stable job I was always a troubled person when I was in second grade I wrote my first suicide note I knew what I drew/wrote and didn't hesitate when I drew/wrote it I told my teacher about it (I was in a after school program) my teacher was around 19 or in her early 20s told me she needed to tell my dad about the drawing, I begged her the entire day to not tell my dad because I was scared that my dad would get mad at me and beat me (I'm hispanic btw) but she didn't want to listen to me but near the end of the day once my dad arrived to pick me up my teacher told him he was clearly worried but when me and my dad got into the car he started yelling at me and demanding me to give him the picture but I refused so he enrolled me in therapy. Before we go any further I wanted to say that the reason I was and still am like this is how I'm treated at home. Therapy helped for a while, my dad would tell my sisters to stop hurting me didn't really work but that was fine I guess but I still felt troubled and it got even worse the more a grew from the spam of 4 years (I left therapy after 2 months) I switched schools and I went to a \"good-intelligent kid\" to a \"bad-attitude kid\" my friends were really toxic I was just to blind to see it I was more of a outcast but still known and hated I became really troubled at this time but not enough to have extream thoughts of suicide or wanting to murder my family, but near the start of 4th grade I transferred schools again and that's when it all started. I became so insecure and didn't really talk to anybody for the first 2 months finally got some friends, lost them 3 months later, got a bit more friends stuck with them one of my new \"friends\" hated me for some reason she would put up excuses for not wanting to hang out with my friends and would cry for really dumb reasons and would get so mad if we didn't give her a lot of attention once she apologized we forgave her and moved on with our day. This was the beginning of 2020 now I had a bully who would whisper to her friends about how I looked and would judge me of what I wore their was rumors spreading that she was the cause of a girl taking her own life in my school which was so big it went on the news a lot of people didn't like her at all and so did I but good thing I didn't see her face again because of quarentine. But anyways what sucked is that I had to be with my sisters we all have our fair shares of anger issues so quarentine made us hate eachother more than ever I once got so mad I threatened to kill my sister with a kitchen knife I asked my dad one time why didn't he enroll me back into therapy because he thought I was slowly going insane threw quarentine and I was but he still didn't enroll me into therapy.

{"article": "My dog was my best friend. The absolute highlight of my life and he was there for me when the world was against me. I was afraid of dogs until I moved in with my friend who had two large dogs, this one being a black kelpie/lab called Quint. He was usually overlooked because he was too energetic for my friend, and the other dog got all the privileges like sleeping on the bed, getting extra treats for being cute etc. I ended up losing my fear of dogs and growing a love for them, understanding their personalities and behaviours. I especially loved Quint because I related to being the most neglected sibling. I saw he just wanted the same treatment. So I started spending time with him, playing with him, both of us learning about eachother. He was about 4yrs when I met him. We bonded over time and I swear it was like no other bond I know, and everyone else saw that as well. Quint was slowly becoming my dog. I’ll never forget the day he was let in from playing outside and instead of both dogs running into my friends room, he ran straight into my room. That would’ve been a 5 times a day habit over 4yrs of his life that was broken in just a few months for me. He jumped up to my bed for love and excited cuddles like I always gave him. He then became my dog and he always helped with my bad mental health. Got me out of the house to walk him everyday, got me into routines of feeding him, got me socialising with people on the street who thought he was cute. I would cuddle him for hours through thunderstorms he was terrified of- I created a sound-proof safe space in my wardrobe where we would both sit and wait out the thunder. \n\nWhen I moved out, my friend said that as much as she loved Quint, he was clearly my dog. Quint chose me. I like to think he was waiting for me, pushing through that minor neglect his whole life because he knew something amazing was coming- which was me. I taught him many tricks like turn around both ways, roll over, bark softly and to bark loudly, even how to close doors. So when I moved, he came with me.\n\nIt was this time I struggled most with my mental health. Heavy into my anorexia, severely underweight, suicidal and constantly self-harmed etc. but I kept going each day because I couldn’t bare to leave my dog. I believed he was the reason I was here- my purpose was to be his owner and to love him like I did.\n\nHe only cried once, and it was when I had come back from a weekend holiday when I attempted suicide after too many drinks. Was in hospital and mental health ward for a few days before I came back. Quint and I were so bonded, but he could see the wound/stitches and smell it. It was only a small cry when I got out of the car to see him, before he was excited again. But I knew why he cried. He knew what had happened and how close I was to leaving this world.\n\nIt was any other night. Someone knocked on our door in a panic saying they had hit someone’s dog with their car. I prayed with everything i had that it wasn’t my boy.\nIt was. He was severely injured. Atleast one leg broken, suspected broken spine as he couldn’t move, lots of open wounds. I knew he was dying. \nIt was freezing. I layed down on the freezing road next to boy and I stayed as strong as I could. I could see in his eyes that he knew what was happening, he knew he was dying, but he was not in pain, and he was relieved and happy that I was with him. I cooed and called him the goodest boy and talked to him like I always did. I told him he will be in an amazing place soon and not to be scared and I told him how much he had changed my life and how much I love him. We lived in a very small town and even though it was midnight, everyone was on the street with us and they were all crying for us. The driver was so upset and I told him I forgave him, it was honestly not his fault, I thanked him for letting me be with my boy in his final moments- because most people don’t get that.\n\nI’ve lost a few family members and have had many traumatic things happen to me. This was the worst of everything. My sunshine, my baby boy. It took all of my strength not to end my life to be with him but I still think about it to this day.\n\nI couldn’t function, let alone find the strength to kill my self. But after all of the initial pain I felt, I realised so many things. I looked back on the time I had with Quint and it made me realise so many things. I hated myself my whole life, believed I was bad, incapable of love, not deserving of anything. But Quint taught me that I AM a good person. The way I looked after him and loved him, and I was his favourite person in the whole world. He made me realise that I deserve a good life, I deserve to get better, I deserve help, I deserve love. Those are all the things he wanted for me and still does. That’s what kept me going through the hardest time in my life. Not only did my best friend die infront of me, my closest friends in real life turned against me and blamed me for his death. I was alone, I had no one to talk to, I was in a place where I knew no one and couldn’t do anything. Had no hope. But I only realised all of these things after he passed away. I guess staying alive and healthy is my way of honouring him. Trying to treat myself with the same love and care that I gave him. Because that’s what he always wanted for me. I saw the pain in him when I was in pain, when I would get drunk every night and self harm everyday. But I always think of him watching over me and I always want to be better, for him. \n\nI never believed in heaven. I thought it was nothingness and blackness when you died. But when he passed away, I fully believed in a magical place. A place that exists just for him. A place for someone with so much love, so much commitment, so much good. There had to be a place for a soul like that. And I believe he is in a beautiful place where he gets to play endlessly with his favourite balls and eat all the treats he wants and there are never any scary thunderstorms.\n\nHe is the biggest thing that has kept me going, even these days when things get hard. As much as I wish I could be with him again, I don’t want to let him down. He wants to see me have the kind of life that I gave him. So I try everyday to be better and to be stronger and I have come so incredibly far that I’m unrecognisable from the sock person I was to the strong and brave person I am now", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 980, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

The idea sounded so bizarre to me, that I started laughing maniacally for some 15 minutes, and then I didn't feel like killing myself anymore.\n\nThere were many other instances, even less dramatic. The truth is that suicide is not an event. It's a prolonged process of working yourself up to the final destination.

I’m gonna explain the entire story here, but if you don’t care to read it all, I’ll include a TLDR at the end for convenience :)\n\nSo for years and years, all the way form pre-school to fifth grade I was best friend with the kid, let’s call him Mark. We were inseparable. Then sixth grade come, where we both had a thing for this girl who we will call Lowis. Neither of us knew we both liked her. I got to her first and she became my girlfriend. Mark instantly hated me and got all of his wrestling friends (he was on the wrestling team btw) to treat me like shit. My parents and Marks parents were good friends, and as soon as they found out that he was bullying me, they put an end to it. Although Mark stopped, unfortunately the other seven wrestlers were not finished with me, and continued to treat me like shit, beat me up, make social media accounts about me promoting me to kill myself, and so on for the next four years. They made my life a living hell. I mean, it was seven vs one. \n\nEvery day I would report to the principle exactly what they did to me. EVERY FUCKING DAY. I thought he was helping, I thought he was trying to put an end to it. Eventually, mind you, this was after four years, when the boys finally received a two day suspension (which is completely bullshit for how they treated me), we found out the principal had taken no action, never called their parents, and sat back and relaxed as the weak theatre kid was being destroyed by seven wrestlers. As soon as I figured out that information, I wanted to kill myself. No one cared about how I was feeling, no one wanted to help me, no one cared, period. Attempted suicide in 8th grade about three times; by cutting, rope, and drowning. Fortunately I was unsuccessful. \n\nThis next part is COMPLETELY out of nowhere btw, I am a massive nerd. I know everything there is to know about Marvel, DC, Star Wars, and so on. As much as I wanted to die, I wanted to live so I could explore the worlds that I actually wanted to live in. Nothing compelled me to live more than imaging myself as Captain America beating the shit out of Hydra agents, or being Doctor Strange and performing spells and shit, I couldn’t give those things up. I literally owe my life to Marvel, and Stan Lee. I couldn’t leave this world if it meant leaving the worlds that I really cared about behind. \n\nTLDR; Seven wrestlers beat the shit out of me mentally, emotionally, and physically on a daily basis all because of a girl. Principal and staff refused to do anything about it and it lasted for four years. Attempted suicide multiple times, but my love for Marvel and other nerd universes kept me here and I couldn’t be more proud of myself for it.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 991, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

I thank the heavens everyday I didn’t, it truly saved my life. I had always enjoyed the outdoors for the sights and exercise but that’s all. It wasn’t until a friend invited me to go hunting knowing I needed to get out and get my mind on something simpler. It wasn’t until I was at the top of a hill overlooking the most beautiful late fall afternoon taking place over Kentucky, considering what I was doing that it finally clicked. I had a million things on my mind, trauma from rough calls, troubles at home, relationship issues, even thoughts of self harm. But here I was sitting at the top of a hill doing my best to blend in to the woods to potentially take a life. Now that sounds brutal but the brutality of it really helped it sink in. Some random deer could be having the time of its life, living in its prime and bam some 22 y/o kid who’s considering offing himself drops it before it’s even aware what’s happening. It’s a truly humbling thing, life can be as great or as bad as you see it but the only guarantee is that we’ll all meet our end.

Where the only real easy day was yesterday, nothing is guaranteed and everything is out to get you. But when you walk in the woods what do you see or hear? Chances are it’s the sounds and sights of animals busy at work living, making the most of another day. We can choose to sit and be stagnant but it just means our death is that much more meaningless.

{"article": "My mom. My dad is getting old. My mom too, but they have a pretty big age gap, 19 years. When my dad dies, my mom will not be able to support herself economically. She needs me. I’m 26, almost 27, I’m one year away from my bachelors. So I’m finally getting closer to being more economically dependent (my career of choice requires a master or PhD, so I’ll have a few more years). \n\nI mean one time even this wasn’t strong enough on my one and only attempt. Where I, obviously, failed. But every other time the thought came this always stopped me. Even to the point where sometimes I just think, when she’s passes, I’ll kill myself then. As I feel like that’s the only thing keeping me going. \n\nI’ve talked to my doctor about this. I did try antidepressants. But I have dysthymia, or as it’s called today: PDD. To really quickly explain, it pretty much means I have been depressed my entire life, but it’s a very mild form of depression, like depression-lite. But when something causes what other would called depression, for me it’s called double depression. Pretty much at these points in my life, I’m literally a millimeter away from killing myself at moment. It’s gone this bad a few times in my life. Like when my sister’s husband died, when I got addicted to amphetamine for a bit, when my other sister got married and moved away (we used to be really close, not so much any more), when I got into a car accident that has left my left shoulder, right hand, lower back, and possibly (this accident may have been the cause of this, but I was so doped up on pain meds I may not have realized) my lower jaw in constant pain. The sister moving and accident happened 2 days a part, that when I attempted one night. I took a shit ton of my pain meds and muscle relaxants, rid the high as much as I could until i knocked out. Well I guess I didn’t take enough, as 14 hours later, I woke up, and realized I’ve as getting late to class. Anyways, like I was saying earlier. I stopped taking the antidepressants because me taking them pretty much made me at baseline, like how most people usually feel, all the time. When I took it, the feeling went so neutral, my neurotic side literally finally stfu. This caused me to have an intense anxiety attack. Every time I took it, it did. At first I didn’t feel anything really when I felt it. But after a while, it started to work. And when it did. I just felt so saddening to realize what I thought was baseline, is pretty low, and me nothing having a higher baseline was what made me so sad and anxiety ridden. Also, when I took it, I felt like a part of my personality was gone. Like I was a shell of who I am. Actually N is one of the highest letters I score in the OCEAN personality test. So it kinda makes sense. I told my doctor and eventually I stopped taking it. And she knows. I’ve kinda gone back to my old way of dealing with my depression, just keeping it to myself and reminding myself my mom needs me. I’m single, I don’t think I want to get with anyone. I kinda feel bad for them. As I don’t think I’m really worth someone else’s love. Note that I say it as in, I don’t think no one can fall for me, I just don’t think I’m worth someone else’s love. So sometimes the thought about after my mom passes, it fears me as, even though I’ve attempted and I want to do it many times, I still fear death. Because there is no turning back. And since my attempt, I’ve done many things in my life that I’ve enjoyed and were worth living for. And I want to continue having those moments. But that’s a permanent solution. And also the act of killing myself, a part from pills, scares me. (Pills are scary too though since you have to wait to die) Like the thought that I could pull a trigger, and not even realize i did, because I’m dead. Is horrifying. But sometimes the pain the depression brings, makes it feel like it’s all worth it. \n\nYes I struggle with depression. But I still try to find something to live for. Right now that’s my mom. When she passes, I’m hoping I’ve gone far down my career path, that my career becomes what I live for. (I’m going into history to become a professor, it has always been my favorite subject in school.

{"article": "Personally, it has been a long time since I have felt suicidal. I would feel this way not because I was going to commit the act, but due to the hopelessness I felt. I was 22 years old. Growing up I was sheltered from the experiences that prepare you for life during those times. Whether it was socially or financially. I had established a great friend group and committed myself to a beautiful girlfriend, but I continued to make bad decisions. From 19-23, I quickly graduated from marijuana, cocaine, opiate painkillers to heroin. The times I felt suicidal were due to the imbalance of illegal drugs in my system, and not knowing how to navigate some of the emotional situations I experienced. When I was 23 I would be charged for 3 felonies. During this arrest I decided to make a change to my life. I had wasted my friend group and my family was suspicious of who I was as a person. Without emotional support outside of a counselor I met with at the methadone, I would rely on the stories told through rap music to make it through the adversities and tough times created from the decisions I made. In 2017 I would decide to quit methadone cold turkey. I continued focusing on my second chance until recently. This summer I eventually realized my shot at second chance was also wasted due to not focusing on everything else that makes you a great person.

{"article": "My story is a little strange.\n\nI had an attempt in January of 2019 by overdose. At the time, I was 18. I had a severe nicotine addiction, and my parents found out (they are very anti-drug, vaping, smoking, etc). I tried to end it all. Went to the psych ward and was denied because the social worker was convinced that this was all for attention. My parents took everything from me that gave me access to the outside world; no phone, no internet access unless it was for school (and even then they watched me the entire time), I was not allowed to drive at this time, but not because they were concerned that I'd do something stupid, but because they didn't want me running off. They also gave me piss tests at random times that could detect nicotine.\n\nIt was my lowest point. \n\nMy comfort came from the furry fandom, specifically a little podcast called the Dragget Show. I had been to two furry conventions in the past year and met the guys behind the Dragget Show, Alkali and Xander. Alkali and I really hit it off. I am a very shy person, but he made me feel like his best friend from high school, even if i barely said a word to him. \n\nThere was a convention in February that I was planning on going to. My father was taking me because he has a friend that lives near where the convention was held (small town outside of Milwaukee). Alkali would be at this convention. At the time, I was still planning my death, but something told me I wanted to see the Dragget Show boys one last time.\n\nTime passes. I'm not doing much better by the time of the convention (given it was only abou a month later, and I was at rock bottom before hand). But I still want to go to the convention.\n\nOh god, that convention changed my perspective. \n\nThere was one moment that really changed me. I was at a daytime music show in the main room of the convention. Alkali was sitting in the back with a friend, and i had wandered in. I sat on the floor next to him. He's bobbing along to the music and just enjoying himself, and I'm doing my best to enjoy it too. At some point, I just get so out of it that I rest my head on his side. I didn't even realize what I was doing until after it happened. But without hesitation, he wrapped his arm around me in a big bear hug. This isn't out of character for Alkali, he is a big hugger, but this was different. It was warmer. It was tighter. It felt real. This is the first time in a long time that I had felt something other than sadness. It took all of my strength not to cry in that moment. He kept his arm around me the remainder of the show. It was during that time that reality hit me. It wasn't my time. I had so much more left in me. If nothing else, I need to be here to live this again.\n\nThis was in February 2019. In the past year and a half, I have been invited to perform at multiple conventions (I am a musician), have been to 7 more since. Alkali and I are still good buddies, even though I haven't seen him since February of this year due to COVID. I've been very successful with therapy. I am in college and currently working as an RA on my campus as well.

{"article": "Like many here, it was always my dog. She saved me many times before she passed. It really does hurt them as much as we think it will too. My friend just committed suicide a few days ago and I have her pets right now. The last time I watched them was after her last attempt. They’d sat with her for almost an entire day until finally someone forced their way in because the dog was barking for hours. This dog is the loudest most energetic dog I know. When he was at my house he was eerily quiet, like the life was taken right out of him. I’m not as good with understanding cat behaviour but the kitten was upset too. She didn’t really want to interact and just stayed close to the dog. \n\nThis time, my friend dropped them off so they didn’t see anything but the only other time they’ve both been away from mom- was then. I’m sure they know something bad happened. They’re relatively calm and sort of adjusting just within my apartment now, but I know they’re still sad. Still, last time she came back, so I think they assume she’ll be back anytime now. The problem is when they see our mutual friends. My friend used to sleep over at another friend’s apartment quite often. So this other friend took the dog up for a couple hours to cuddle him cause she was lonely. He thought she was there. Even though he would’ve known by the scent- he still searched and searched, he got up and ran to check any noise. He barked at anything brushing by the door. When he couldn’t find her he’d droop his tail and let himself fall onto the floor, nose pressed to the door. He’d cry and during one of his searches he found a pillow that still smelled like his mom. He licked it and cried the rest of the time he was there. He can’t be consoled when he’s like that because literally nothing else matters to him. He doesn’t want the tastiest treats, toys or anyone else’s love. He just wants mom. \n\nWhen he came back to my place, he ran to the cat, gave her a few licks and leaned close while she pressed her head into his chest. They know, they just don’t know it all. And there will never be a way to tell them. They might spend forever waiting. I wanted to get someone to take him into ICU before they pull the plug but the unit’s on lockdown because of COVID. I won’t get to see her again either. I don’t want it to sound like I’m looking down on my friend, I’m so lucky my dog was enough for me but she was so sick and in so much pain. I could never hold that against someone. She did her best and she made sure her pets would be safe and loved. I only hope that if anyone else is in a dark place and they see this- that they realize their pets need them and love them more than they know, and that that can keep them going.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1037, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": "Meditation. \n\nI had decided to do it, just hadn’t figured out how. I was a few weeks away from my date. \n\nI guess I looked around and saw that I was just incredibly lonely.

(Opening up has always been hard. Writing this reply is terrifying.)\n\nI realized a few things in that head space. First, every day was one step closer to the end, and the closer I got, the less chance I would have to change my mind. Second, if I wanted to try getting help, it had to be right then, it couldn’t wait. It was my first time in therapy and the therapist got me back on my meditation routine which I had already given up on for about a year. (I had practiced it for a solid year before that.)\n\nThrough sitting quietly I eventually noticed that the emptiness, loneliness, hollow feeling was just that, a feeling, a trick being played on me by the disease. I still feel it, often, but now I recognize it as a lie. Meditation taught me to see it clearly and to build in that little moment between a feeling and a reaction.

{"article": "I've been diagnosed as having Bi-polar type 2 disorder with suicidal thoughts. I've never self-harmed and haven't made an attempt since I was about 15 years old. I am blessed with the fact that I am surrounded by loving family and friends, and their grief over my death is what has stopped me from killing myself. My advice to anyone dealing with suicidal thoughts and depression is to find something, anything, or anyone to hold on to. To fight that voice in your head that says \"They don't care. They don't love me. They hate me. I'm worthless, I should just die.\" I'm lucky in that I have close friends who I can confide in and talk about my darker thoughts. The key in my opinion, is to find a person, an activity, a pet to keep you going.\n\nI live at home with my Mom. I can't help but imagine her horror and pain if she found me dead or heard of it. I can't imagine how guilty my friends (most whom I have known since elementary school and middle school) would feel if I had killed myself. I feel like suicide is also the last restort of attention seeking. The ultimate cry of PAY ATTENTION TO ME. LOVE ME. PLEASE. SOMEONE! To force people to recognize our value in their life, but I think ultimately, at least in my case, it's not that others don't see me. It's that I don't see THEM seeing me. Just another one of those quirks of mine that I constantly combat. \n\nAnother tip that may be helpful is, cry! If you're sad, cry! Even if it's over something dumb. Cry by yourself if you have too. Too many people are bottling up their emotions, especially men (without evidence on hand, I believe men are the leading victims of suicide. I've probably read that somewhere.) So, to the men, like myself who have issues with their emotions, PLEASE find that space, that place or person who you can be emotional with or at. \n\nIf you don't have anyone, or don't feel like anyone in your life cares, please feel free to reach out to me. Let's be pen pals, we'll keep each other alive. We'll share each others pain and known we are acknowledged and cared about. The problem with the darkness of depression and suicide is that it makes it hard to see everyone else who is suffering in that same darkness. We can't see each other, but we are all there, together. All you have to do is call out, with all your strength and as loud as possible. I AM HERE! WE ARE HERE! We'll make it through this storm together. \n\nEven in this darkness I feel you, your presence and warmth. I can hear you struggle against the crashing waves. I am reaching, with all my strength as I too struggle against the endless tide of my own misery. Reach for me too. Struggle with me. We'll come out together. We are all human.

{"article": "I tried to kill myself in January. I had made many mistakes throughout my life, but this was by far the biggest of them all. I had been unsure of my path in life for years since college, kind of just floating by day and night wondering if I'd ever get my shit together. All my hobbies progressively gave me less and less happiness. My lack of success in life progressively dropped me lower and lower into my own darkness. Then one morning, I realized that my fear of dying had become less than my fear of being unsuccessful in life, so I walked into the kitchen and grabbed a knife and went to the bathroom.\n\nI pressed the knife against my wrist and sat in the shower for a good 10 minutes trying to weigh the pros and cons. Once the pros started to tilt the scales, I searched for what little courage I had in my heart and dragged the blade across my left wrist. It hurt like hell and the wound looked horrifying but to my dismay, it didn't seem like it was bleeding enough. The pain was immense but at that point, what kept me determined was the idea that it would go away soon enough. So I pressed the blade into the wound once more and dug it even deeper. I turned the shower on and let it run against my wrist, lied down and just gave up. I was done. I passed out and 20 minutes later, I woke up. The wound coagulated and stopped bleeding. It was still wide open, but not bleeding. I was dreading my own life even more so. I decided I would try overdosing on sleeping pills but I didn't have any so I had to go pick some up. As I was getting ready to leave, I suddenly got too tired to move and just went to sleep. My mom found me and saw what I had done. I think part of me actually did die when I saw the anguish in my mom's eyes. I never saw my parents cry before. The pain of seeing them suffer from my own selfishness was the worst.  \n\n\nIt's hard sometimes, but don't ever give in to the idea that ending yourself is the right path.

{"article": "My sophomore math and one of my English teachers tried to do this for me. Was in a serious state of depression/apathy and kinda close to suicide for a long time.

And my math teacher legit used half of each detention to teach me about a week's worth of lessons I didn't pay attention to in class. He wouldn't let me zone out since it was just us and maybe a few others. I caught on the work really fast during those but felt terrible a lot of the time because I would still treat him like shit in classes (generally ignoring everything because I just didn't care). One time he pointed out that I was smart enough to figure it out in such a short time and asked why I didn't do anything in class while another kid was with us so I just kinda shrugged it off and basically told him to go fuck himself. I think he understood though. In our one-on-one detentions, I tried to be very respectful and apologized a lot but couldn't explain to him why I was being edgy as a defensive tactic around other kids.

{"article": "the fear that if i failed again they would never let me back out.\n\nMy experience during a 5150 was probably more traumatic than anything else i've ever been through in my life, and i was raped pretty much daily for 9 years. At least during that i could dissociate- not to diminish the horror of rape but after 9 years you develop ways to cope. i had no ways to cope with this hospital stay.\n\nWhen I went in, I had already been awake for 18hrs. Which isn't that bad, but you know, you're ready to just take a nap or something soon. I was dehydrated as fuck (pills aren't a good way to try to go folks), emotionally wrecked, and still having to comfort my mom who had enabled and encouraged my abuser for years. So that was fun.\n\nI finally got into the actual mental hospital at like 6 am, so I'd been up for nearly 24hrs. I was knackered. THey took away my bra, and my sweater, and checked everywhere to make sure I didn't have anything. I didn't get my bra or sweater back, which was really uncomfortable because it was cold, so i got to be depressed, exhausted, violated, and anxious that my nipples were poking.\n\nI sat in the room in the dark waiting for someone to come get me. Another resident came over and said hello, made some small talk. It was incredibly kind, however this apparently was what it took to get the nurses to do something because they showed up to yell at him. So now I felt very alone, and sad that i got someone in trouble who was just trying to be nice. cool.\n\nI finally got taken to a room, and the other woman in the room I think had dementia because she was yelling about how my bed was her sons bed and i wasn't allowed there, and then fell into speaking a language i\"ve never heard.\n\nI got to lay down in a strange cold place with the lights on for 20 minutes before someone came in and yelled at me to get up for breakfast. I was exhausted. I wasn't hungry. Too bad!\n\nSo i go into the big shared room and they give me mymeal. I shouldn't complain about free food, and I'm not really: i just was not hungry at all and bland eggs with dry wheat bread slices just did not appeal. I took a few bites but wasn't going to do much more. I was scolded like a child. A woman sitting next to me who was very much a grandmother was praised as if she were a dog or something when she finished her food. I asked if i could get my sweater back and was ignored.\n\nI got an hour of sleep before being roused again for group therapy. We sat in a circle and a \"therapist\" handed out sheets of affirmatives statements, alll along the lines of \"i can choose to be happy if i want to.\" I was grumpy, tired, depressed, and past my limit of being able to cope, so this was just too much. We had to go around the circle and read our line and explain how we would practice it. The woman from earlier was bi-polar and was struggling to explain how she would be able to just... choose... to not be. This broke me- she didn't need this, she needed a friend. and I didn't need this shit either. So I said so: I said it was bullshit, that we can't just \"choose\" to be happy, we have medical conditions that need treatment with therapy and maybe medication. If we could just \"choose\" to be happy we wouldn't be here would we?! the alleged therapist, who by this point I seriously doubted because even with a psych 101 class which does not qualify at *all* as real psych knowledge I knew that if you're bi-polar or have clinical depression/anxiety, etc you are incapable of just choosing to be happy. The gal next to me who was a nervous wreck poor gal read her line and said that she just agreed with me. The session dissolved from there and ended after she insisted she knew what we were going through because her husband had depression.\n\nI got more sleep.\n\nI finally talked to a doctor who asked if i had anything i was good at. I said untying knots, and apparently this was the wrong answer because he was mad. He asked if I had any recurring thoughts, and I didn't really know what that meant at the time. so i said sometimes my thoughts will just seeem to run onandonandonandonwithoutpauseloopingandrepeating, but that just made him even more annoyed and he said that was normal. He asked if there was anyone I could call. I said i don't know anyone's numbers that I'd want to call, but my therapist might. He called my therapist, i went back to the group.\n\nWe were supposed to have more group therapy but no one was feeling it so the guy left. we did word searches, which... okay.\n\nI asked the nurses for my sweater because it was still cold. Or rather, I tried to: I tried to be polite and wait to be acknowledged and they ignored me. I made a little sound in case they hadn't noticed me walk up, and they continued to ignore me. Finally I just spoke up and asked, and was just told no. I asked if I could have a brush, or a tooth brush or something. I was ignored. Ok. Back to word searches.\n\nMy therapist called my dad and laid out... a lot of what happened. I talked to the therapist at the hospital again who was less annoyed and after I described what had been going on, he agreed that this was not the right place for me. They sent me home with my mom, with a plan that I would be moving in with my dad ASAP. i was supposed to do an intensive outpatient therapy, thing as part of it. I got my sweater back.\n\nIt was such a dehumanizing experience that I didn't go back to *any* therapy for 5 years and spent a lot of time crying myself to sleep because I needed help but I was terrified they'd send me back. idk. it sounds silly but they didn't even treat us like people, we were annoyances. we bothered them when we just needed help.\n\nI did eventually go back to therapy, had a breakthrough, found a way out and got better.

I'd tried telling my parents about my depression before, but he denied it, insisting I was fine and didn't need any help.\n\nOn days when I'd been more seriously considering and even planning out my suicide (was in a mobile home park and was given freedom finally to go to the park at the end of my street on my own at 14/15, was planning on going out near there since it backed up to a massive forest no one ever went into) my dog would stay by me and follow me around the house regardless the room I'd go into, and I would remember how she'd help during my episodes. \n\nOn March 25th at 12:35 AM, my pet rabbit that I'd had since I was 5 died, she was 9. I was crying so hard then (honestly, thinking back on it to write this post I'm tearing up) and Biscuit sat down in front of me and nosed her way to my face to lick my tears and even let me hug her. She isn't too fond of hugs, but she lets me hug her when I'm having an episode.\n\nWhen I was planning my suicide, my dog would find me and just walk up to me, putting her head against me for me to pet her. I don't know how she always knew when I was thinking about it, but whenever she did I would think of that night back in 2016, and then of the days she'd so carefully lick my legs after my surgeries, how she \"kisses\" spots she knows we're hurt (she'll even try to pull off bandages from getting blood drawn or something, she knows it's not supposed to be there, so she tries to get it off) but was extremely careful after my surgeries. Maybe she somehow knew that these were serious surgeries without us needing to say or keep her from jumping up on me, but that was something else that kept me from ending it.\n\nThe thought of my dog wondering why one day I would walk out to the woods and never come home, or go to bed one night and never wake up. It hurt. Still does, and she's still the reason I keep from hurting myself again. Sure I've made a promise to my partner I wouldn't, but really, it's for my dog. She'll be 6 this November, and I'm getting a tattoo of her paw print and birthday next month. I love this dog, though she's the only one I've had so far, she's helped me through so much; I'm working to get her registered as my emotional support animal with how well she helps me with my anxiety and depression episodes.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1047, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "I've struggled with depression, paranoia, dissociation, and suicidal thoughts for almost 6 years now. Some of those have gotten better and some have gotten worse over the years. I read a comment once about a woman describing a nightmare she had. The dream was pretty simple and just consisted of her being dead, but being able to watch her husband live on without her. He'd come home and sit by himself with no one to make him smile and the woman having the dream would feel so bad that she left him behind and hope that someone would just check on him. It made me think about my girlfriend and how sad she would be if I never came home again. No one to hold her at night and tell her to drive safe and that she's loved every day she leaves for work. It made me think of how much I might hurt my parents, family, and friends. They'd all wonder why the never knew and if there were signs they just missed. It made me worry about who would play with my dog and pet my cat when I'm gone. \n\nThinking about the people I would hurt always clears my head. I still struggle with these thoughts often. Wondering if I'm worth the life I've been given. I question myself and my sanity and if I'll ever succeed at what I strive for and if one day when I tell people that I'm doing good if I'll mean it. My girlfriend helps me a lot, more than I feel like I deserve. Nights are the hardest for me. When everyone else is asleep and I'm up all by myself with nothing to do, I start laying in to myself. I tell myself horrible things and make it for me to sleep. I struggle with adhd too which makes it very hard for me to focus on my work. Because of this I miss deadlines or procrastinate which just makes the bad thoughts worse. I'm working on getting medication now, but it sure is damn hard and expensive. One day I hope things will be better. I dont want to think about killing myself or to have my head spinning all day long. I don't want to feel a bottomless well of paranoid energy when I go out only to feel exhausted at the exact same time. I wish I could focus on what I want to work on and actually get it done and not go to sleep at night telling myself what a disappointment I am.\n\nIt can come out of nowhere too. Sometimes I'll just hate the sound of my voice one day and all the sudden every other thought becomes about how much I hate myself. My parents and family are great, but not the kind of people I can talk about this stuff with. Part of what I struggle with is how private I like to keep my life. I don't like when people know a lot about me or what goes on in my life. It just puts me on edge and makes me uncomfortable so I'm very happy with people not knowing. My girlfriend knows all about it and talks with me regularly to make sure I'm doing okay and it helps that I feel like I'm not worrying TOO MANY people. Worrying her is bad enough, but I do have good days with the bad and I know she cares and just wants to help. I'll never be able to thank her enough for everything she does for me or tell her how much I love her. I could use every breath from now until the day I die to say \"I love you\" and it still wouldn't be 1/100th of how much I care about her.\n\nEven now, I'm typing all this out at 1:38am in an old reddit thread that I'm sure no one will even find my comment in and I don't know why. Maybe I just wanted to get some thoughts off my chest. All I do know is how tired I am. Just existing can be so exhausting sometimes. Having to put on my personality that everyone loves and prefers is draining. I'm so scared too. Every glance can put me on edge and the world around me can just be so loud in my head sometimes. It almost feels like the sound when you walk into a crowded cafeteria. Everyone talking about different things all at once. It's loud and disorienting and you can't really make anything out that you hear. It's all just a blob of sound. Sometimes it's even hard to think or speak with all that sound going on. I wonder if I'll ever be where I want in life or if I'm just destined to be a loser. I don't even feel like I have anymore thoughts in my head right now. I know I went way overboard on my answer, but I appreciate the outlet to atleast just type out what's going on a bit.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1049, "url": null, "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "There’s been a couple of different episodes and in all of them I’ve come out for different reasons.\n\nOne particularly difficult one, I essentially managed to get through by brooding very dramatically.\n\nIt started by being cheated on during my first marriage and finding out by logging into my Facebook messenger while she was chatting with the guy, making plans to meet with him. I had a very difficult childhood and generally had avoided intimacy up until meeting this girl, who I loved deeply enough to leave my home town and country for, and marry entirely too soon.\n\nImmediately after finding out, alone (she was having this conversation at a hospital where her brother was critically ill), I felt my world fall apart around me. I took to the concrete floor and hit my head against it as hard as I could four times.

It helped me heal, but years afterwards I still have “demons” in me which are angry and in pain from going through that.\n\nWhat saved me is facing the reality of the situation. It was acknowledging how unprepared I was to face it, acknowledging the pain I felt (and sometimes still feel), and suffer as much as I could until there was no suffering left to be done, until I was bored with suffering so much.

As you are likely aware, President Obama was elected in large part due to his ability to eloquently speak for African Americans during his campaign against Hillary Clinton. It has been widely acknowledged that an assumption Clinton made about her ability to win over this demographic led her campaign strategy into a trap where she lost support from progressives who were supposed to be her base.\n\nWhat is not as widely known, however, is that this assumption was based on Clinton's close relationship to President Bill Clinton. Both of them assumed they would be able to win over African Americans due to their shared understanding of the systemic racism facing African American communities in America.\n\nPresident Clinton's actions as president, however, reveal that he was very much a white man who has no true understanding of systemic racism in America. He is the first and only President to grant federal funding for private schools (called charter schools) even though such institutions are widely known to be discriminatory against African American students.\nPresident Clinton also oversaw the passage of the 1994 crime bill, which led to a significant increase in police power and incarceration rates for African Americans. This had a very damaging effect on many black families, especially given that President Clinton expressed support for \"family values\" during his campaign.\n\nThe main reason he could not address racism is that President Clinton was a white man who grew up in the 1950's. He was accustomed to the very limited forms of systemic racism facing African Americans at this time and had no experience with the much more intense forms of racism faced by black Americans today, which stem from mass incarceration, police brutality, biased court practices, and other issues.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1088, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": "I would seek a solution to this problem of the asteroid as quickly and efficiently as possible. This could be done in a number of ways, depending on my resources at hand:\n\n1) If I had several months or years before the predicted collision, I may try to build some kind of spacecraft that could push the asteroid out of its path. However, even with all humanity working together on this project (unlikely), it is unlikely we would have enough time to do so. More likely we wouldn't get started soon enough for there to be any hope of success. It also begs the question whether such an effort would really have much impact on what will happen anyway; surely futile gestures are usually not worth our efforts? Unless this was something meaningful like ensuring the survival or one's friends and family - which can sometimes mean more than oneself - then perhaps it isn't worth expending our energy here? That said, I should still investigate if there were any realistic solutions available in case they turned out to be viable after all. We should always exhaust every reasonable possibility we can think up because you never know when you might find a new opportunity arising that allows for these possibilities become realizable when previously they weren't due to impassable obstacles.\n\n2) If I had no time to build a spacecraft, then I might try to divert the asteroid's path myself through some kind of physical action. For example, if it was possible for me to get close enough, perhaps I could push the asteroid off course by throwing an object at it or drilling some holes into its surface and altering its trajectory that way? But once again this is problematic; even if such a thing were possible (which may be unlikely given how far out in space our asteroids are), would my efforts really have much impact on what will inevitably happen anyway? After all, we can't do anything about natural disasters or accidents due to human carelessness - like nuclear power plant meltdowns – but these things still tend to happen regardless of our actions.\n3) If I had no time to build a spacecraft and could not physically alter the asteroid's path, then there is not much else I can do except wait for its inevitable collision with earth. But even if we assume that this will happen anyway, perhaps it is still better than doing nothing at all? After all, many people don't believe in an afterlife or any form of life after death; according to most religions either you go to heaven or hell when you die. It may be possible that some kind of soul exists beyond our current bodies but until we have evidence for such an idea (and despite efforts from many scientists), this seems a little far-fetched. In other words, without any proof about what happens after death (there are plenty who think they can prove something like this but it almost always turns out they were wrong so far), isn't it likely that death will simply entail the end of consciousness altogether - whatever consciousness really means? So even if Trump's prediction was true and humanity didn't survive long enough in order to evolve into another species or whatever, wouldn't that ultimately be better than living indefinitely under capitalism?\n\nI have heard a lot of people say that life has no meaning. In my view, however, it seems that there is always some kind of meaning to be found wherever we look; whether in our relationships with each other or the work we do to support ourselves and others. True, sometimes life can seem meaningless but this usually happens when you're stuck doing something boring or repetitive for most of your waking hours - like working as an office manager or something similar.\n\nOf course, there are also other things to be considered: for example, the fact that many people don't really care if they live or die. For some it doesn't matter one bit if they have a meaningless existence until death; these types of people tend to be rather cold and unfeeling towards others. There may even be some who actively enjoy cruelty and suffering inflicted on others just because of their own twisted sense of what is right or wrong (what we call sociopaths). How much better would life on earth be without such people? I imagine most of us would agree that this would make life better but again, how likely is it this will actually happen?\n\nCapitalism is a system which aims to generate profit for the benefit of capitalists and their lackeys. These days it seems that capitalism is concerned only with profit; most people who support it seem more interested in getting rich than doing anything meaningful or important. In fact, many people criticize those who do things to help others as naïve idealists because they consider such actions pointless or irrelevant given how the world works according to them.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1089, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "I think that pineapple on pizza is a very interesting and controversial matter. It is interesting because it brings up many questions about society, such as who should be allowed to eat what food? When we are sitting at home watching TV and eating dinner with our family, we might have some sort of emotion when somebody puts something new into their mouth like pineapple. There may even be feelings of disgust or terror if the person really dislikes it. There are also social norms that can play a big role in this situation: for example, you would not want to offend any friends or relatives by not sharing your own opinion on the subject (even though you do not personally care). On the other hand, there are times where these emotions come second to simply enjoying a delicious meal despite having foods placed upon it which you might prefer were absent.\n\nThe first step in answering any question is to define what you mean by the term 'okay'. I have defined okay as being morally appropriate, but this definition itself raises a new question: why are some things okay? We can see that it would be good for humans to survive and thrive. It seems logical then that most things which help humans do so are also morally acceptable. Humans cannot thrive without food, so it must be morally right for people to put food on their pizza. Of course there is a limit to how much we should consume; if we eat too much or unhealthy foods and become obese, our health suffers. So the next time you ask yourself whether pineapple on pizza is ok - look at your body.\n\nAnother interesting question which can be asked is 'who decides what is okay?' The answer to this question depends on how you view society. If you believe that everyone should have a say in moral matters, then the people of society together would decide what was morally acceptable. However, if you are an individualist and believe that each person should make their own decisions without any interference from others, then it makes sense for one to simply act as they please so long as they do not harm anyone else.\n\nI think that the final question which needs to be addressed is 'why do some people not like pineapple on their pizza?' Well, I have a simple answer for you: they are wrong. By this I mean that there is no logical reason behind it whatsoever. Some of them may say things like \"pineapple has a bad taste\" or \"it looks weird\" but these arguments have no substance and can easily be dismissed by simply observing the fact that roughly half of all humans enjoy eating it and none of them seem to suffer any negative consequences as a result.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1093, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

This assumption is justified by looking at Earth's history, where only one species has become self-aware in all of time.\n\nThe fact that humans are the only self-aware species to evolve on Earth suggests that it took a tremendous amount of time for life to become intelligent. Life may have been around much longer before we developed intelligence, but this would mean there should be many other planets out there with complex life and even more sophisticated organisms.\n\nIn this scenario, if intelligent life is rare then there will be billions of planets with complex organisms on them. Some of these would have even evolved to the point where they are self-aware beings similar to humans.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1107, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "Imagine that you are given $1,000 everyday you don't poop. How would you maximize this opportunity?\n\nThis is an interesting question indeed! So let us first consider the following: What happens if I keep pooping? Well, since I get a thousand dollars each day that passes without me pooping, then each time I poop it means losing a thousand dollars. Since there are about 250 working days in a year (five weekdays per week for 50 weeks), which means 2500000$ over the course of one year . If we assume my salary does not increase or decrease by any amount during the next few years and also assuming all money earned will stay fixed at $1000 per day , then we can conclude that everytime I poop it costs me about three hundred thousand dollars . Thus if anyone were to want to maximize their earnings they should stop shitting as soon as possible ! Now what does happen if someone keeps on shitting ? Each time he/she shit s he/ she loses 1000$, but since he/ she is doing so everyday this person must earn some other income from another source such as his job or investments etc.. This additional income has to be greater than - say - 300k else otherwise he /she would never go on with his shitty lifestyle. However no one can predict for sure how much additional income someone makes in addition to those 1000$. Let's assume however that these earnings come out equal i n value of 3000$ daily while still being lower th an 300k; thus meaning our shitty friend will always have more gains from continuing t o shit rather than stopping , even though they do lose 1 000$ every single day.\n\nSo in conclusion, unless your salary is greater than $300000 per year and also never ever decreases in value, then you should stop pooping . However if one's income does fall short to such amount then they will still have higher gains from continuing their shitty lifestyle.\n\nI wonder though, does this analysis hold true for other people who do not shit?\nAlso, I have a question for you: If someone is given $1,000 everyday they don't fart do you think they should continue to fart or stop ?\nAnd also, what if someone is given $1,000 everytime they don't smell ?

The term was first used by Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1844 while writing his book 'Essays: First Series' (Emerson 6). This type of thought has been around for thousands of years though. Humanists believe that humans are capable of self-realization through reason and science.\n\nHumanism is heavily influenced by the Age of Enlightenment and the Renaissance. The idea that human beings are capable of discovering truth for themselves, without any sort of external authority or dogma, is one that has been growing in popularity since this time.\nIn The Age of Enlightenment, philosophers such as John Locke and David Hume laid the foundations for humanism. They thought that empirical evidence was more important than religious ideology when it came to understanding reality.\n\nIn the modern day, humanism is most popular in Europe and the United States. In fact, it was during this time that a lot of religious thinkers began to take ideas from Humanists. They believed they had very similar philosophies.\nFor example, many Catholic doctrines were influenced by Humanism. The Catholic Church believed that the way to heaven was through faith in God and Christ, but Humanists thought there could be a better approach.\n\nThey thought that one could be good without belief in God. Humanists believed that a person can do good deeds through reason and science, not necessarily out of fear of punishment or desire for reward", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1111, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

They take a lot of vacations and often retire early.\n\nSweden's main problems are the result of too much equality and democracy. They have no leaders, so everyone does whatever they please. This is caused by a lack of coordination in their government - there has not been any effort to find one person who would take charge, instead leaving the day-to-day administration to uneducated bureaucrats.\n\nThe Swedish government has not had a leader for over two decades. The last person who tried to take charge, Gustaf Adolphus, was killed in a violent coup d'etat after only six years.\nMost of the Swedish people are apathetic - they do not take an active interest in their own government. They have a constitutional monarchy, but no one is willing or able to provide leadership. Also, many Swedes love equality so much that they think it would be immoral for some person above them to tell them what to do; therefore there is no strong central authority.\n\nAnother reason for Sweden's problems is their lack of resources.

The ultimate root of all human behavior is the pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain, this behavioral drive manifests itself in every decision made by a person. For instance, if one were to ask why does a man work? He would respond that he works for his family so they can live comfortably and happily. If asked why does he want his family to live in comfort? He responds that the reason is because it will make him happy.\n\nAnother example would be asking: Why do people always say \"thank you\" after someone has done something nice for them? They respond back with some answer about manners or politeness but really at its core it is because it makes them feel better/sadder etc (depending on who they are). Also similar in regards to when someone says sorry; either out of guilt or fear depending on what the situation was.\n\nHumans are rather complex creatures, they think about things in many different ways and can respond to the same question with varying answers. For instance a person might ask: What is more important? God or money? A Christian would say that God was more important than anything else while a materialistic atheist would claim that money was the most important thing. Both of these views stem from their own personal experiences with life; after all, how could one possibly know what it's like to be an omnipresent being able to create matter out of nothing?\n\nAnother example would be the two sides of morality; one side asserts that everything should go and people should do what they want with no regard for others, while the other claims that this is wrong because it interferes with someone else's right to life. Both sides are correct in their arguments but neither can claim that theirs is more moral than another.\n\nAs you can see, humans are complex creatures that live in a world where morality is subjective and their own feelings on the matter effect how they interpret any given situation. This makes it very difficult for one to make a claim of which perspective is correct.\n\nSo then what exactly is the point of all this?

{"article": "The immune system is an extremely complex system. It is composed of many biological cells and organs with various different functions that all work together to defend the body against foreign entities such as disease causing organisms. The human body has evolved to be able to recognize these foreign bodies, destroy them, and create antibodies for them so they don't cause harm in the future.\n\nThe immune system is composed of two parts, the innate and adaptive immune systems. The innate immune system is a general response that all creatures have to foreign bodies; it has no memory or ability to learn from experience so it cannot respond specifically against pathogens that attack repeatedly. However, this makes it extremely efficient at eliminating many different kinds of infections simultaneously.\n\nThe adaptive immune system is a highly specific response to the defenses that bacteria and viruses use against each other. Bacteria have evolved multiple mechanisms in order to be able to survive inside of a host, and thus avoid being attacked by the innate immune system. These include biofilms, toxins (which modify/inhibit signaling between cells), proteins which allow them to evade detection by white blood cells and components which prevent phagocytosis.\n\nThe adaptive immune system is also very specific and therefore has a lot of memory; it will quickly destroy pathogens that have been encountered before, but it can also create an immunity to them so they cannot attack the host in the future. The adaptive immune system keeps a database of all foreign bodies that it detects, so when something new infects the body, it can compare its genetic sequence to previous invaders and create antibodies against any commonalities.\n\nWhen a bacteria or virus infects the body, it is first attacked by white blood cells that try to destroy its cell wall and other defenses so they can ingest it. However, this process takes time because after phagocytosis occurs, the pathogen must be identified before an appropriate antibody can be created for it.\n\nThe bacteria and other pathogens can also attack the host's immune system by infecting its white blood cells. This is called lysis, where the pathogen releases toxins or enzymes that break down cell walls and allow the pathogen to escape before it can be destroyed.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1128, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "What do you do when dentist is fixing your teeth? Let us first ponder on the meaning of \"fixing\". The dictionary defines it as \"to repair or set right\" and this seems to capture the essence of what we commonly understand by the word. What does it mean to fix something, though? It is generally accepted that a thing can be fixed if its parts are somehow put together in such a way that they work correctly. For example, let's say I buy some electronic device which turns out not to function properly because one of its components was broken during transportation. In order for me to fix my device I must take apart its individual components and then put them back together again so that they work correctly.\nThis brings us to the question at hand: What is a human? A human, unlike an electronic device or any other inanimate object is a living creature with feelings and emotions. When we fix something we may alter its outward appearance but that's not all there is to fixing things. The part of our devices which make them work are made up of mechanical parts (like gears) and electrical components (such as transistors). In contrast, the important parts of humans are their organs which are made out of flesh, blood and bone. These organs have no gears or moving parts like those found in machines so it cannot be said that their function can be fixed by simply reassembling the individual pieces.\nFor a human to be fixed then, means that its organs must be put back together in such a way that they work correctly. This is what we call \"being healed\". A human can't be healed if the parts are not all there and this raises an important question: What happens when some of our body parts are missing? In normal cases (for example, an amputation caused by disease or accident) the missing part is replaced with another one. This replacement may come from either the person's own body (such as fingers) or from other people (organ donation). However, if no replacements are available then healing becomes impossible regardless of how well you reassemble the remaining pieces.\n\nNow, let's look at the case of \"psychos\". The dictionary defines a psycho as someone who is mentally ill or unstable. Mental illness can manifest itself in many ways and one of them is when a person loses contact with reality to such an extent that they start suffering from hallucinations and delusions. For example, if you were walking around your house naked one day and suddenly thought that there was a monster hidden under your bed then you would probably be diagnosed as being schizophrenic since this clearly shows that you have lost touch with reality.\n\nNow, when a person is hallucinating or suffering from delusions you can't really tell them that the monster isn't real. If people around them insist on telling them that there's no monsters under their bed then they may think that these other people are also crazy and of course this would only make things worse.\n\nThe fact that a person is hallucinating or suffering from delusions doesn't mean however that they're not seeing the world as it actually is. For instance, if I were to tell you that there's a monster in your room but you know for sure that there isn't then this would be an example of me lying to you about reality.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1133, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "The human body is a unique and interesting object in many respects. The fact that it houses the seat of consciousness, for example, might be considered rather strange by some superhuman intelligences. A possible explanation for this is that our intelligence has come to exist as a product of natural selection (in my opinion). This process selects certain traits which ultimately lead to increased fitness over others—the ones more conducive to reproductive success—and these traits are then passed down through generations. Among these traits are an ability to recognize other organisms of one's own species and distinguish them from those belonging to different species.\n\nIndeed, the human body is quite strange.

{"article": "First of all, I would like to make a distinction between 'culture' and 'civilization'. A civilization is typically defined by an increasing degree of sophistication in the tools it creates. The first stone tools were primitive, but over time these evolved into ever-more sophisticated devices capable of producing more and better food from less work. Such things as fire, spears, shovels and plows are examples of this progress. When the earliest civilizations reached a certain level of technological complexity they began to build cities which included houses for living in along with buildings for religious practices (churches), government (courthouses) schools (classrooms), hospitals (hospitals), entertainment centers (casinos), etc., until we have what we presently consider modern cities.\n\nCultures are something else. They are the shared, collective values of a given civilization--the things that make 'us,' versus 'them'. So while many civilizations have built cities, they do not all have cultures.\n\nFor example, before Columbus arrived in North America there were Indians living here who had no concept of school buildings since their culture did not value education as we do.\nSo, to answer your question, I would have to say yes and no. On the one hand it is true that a civilization must destroy other cultures in order to survive. There is simply not enough room for two civilizations of equal sophistication\noccupying the same space at the same time.\n\nOn the other hand, a culture may survive if it is sufficiently compatible with the civilization which conquers it. For example, Rome conquered much of Europe and Africa but left many local cultures intact because they were sufficiently similar to Roman culture.\n\nYou might also consider the historical example of Japan. When it was invaded by western powers, its culture survived because it had evolved to be compatible with Western ways.\nI hope this answers your question.

{"article": "I would say that there are a few different ways to deal with the problem of struggling to stay awake at work. One option, which is perhaps the least enjoyable but also potentially most effective, is simply to get more sleep. You need your rest and so your body naturally has an urge to fall asleep when you start yawning or feeling tired, in order for it to be able to fully recover from its exertions during the day. This might be difficult if you have trouble sleeping due to anxiety you experience on a daily basis (but then again could just as easily not be true), however getting enough sleep should help reduce this since it will give your mind adequate time and opportunity for recovery.\n\nAnother option is to try and identify what it is that's causing the problem. Is it your work environment? Are you unable to focus on your tasks due to a generally noisy or distracting environment? Then dealing with this may be as simple as asking for things such as headphones if they are available, or earplugs in order to block out ambient noise.\n\nIs it possible that you have an underlying condition (such as narcolepsy) or general sleep disorder which makes getting enough sleep difficult? If so, then I would suggest consulting your doctor about the possibility of obtaining a medical prescription for something like Modafinil. This is often used to help people with sleeping difficulties in situations where they can't get enough restful sleep on their own.\nIs your problem related to stress? If so, I would recommend just trying to relax. This might be difficult if you feel chronically stressed (and may not even help), but if this is a temporary situation then it's possible that getting some breathing exercises and simply taking things more slowly should help reduce the amount of stress which you experience in general.\n\nIf none of these options sound appealing, then I suppose you could try a more long-term approach. If you are in an environment which is noisy and distracting (and have no way to block it out), or simply find yourself stressed due to your day job, then perhaps consider how much longer this situation will be necessary for. Is there something better out there? Perhaps think about if now is the time to go back to school and get that degree that everyone was always telling you was such a good idea.\n\nI don't really have any direct suggestions for how to reduce the amount of stress you experience at work, but hopefully some of these other options will help.

{"article": "The inflation was a result of Roman currency being based on precious metals. This served as the supply for coins in circulation, which meant that there were not enough coins to go around.\n\nThis happened because Roman currency was based on precious metals, so there wasn't enough money to go around. They tried to deal with this by debasing their currency, and switching from silver denarii (the most common coin) to bronze coins. This was a disaster because it made inflation worse.\n\nThe reason for this was that the silver in the denarii (which had previously been a form of money) were then extracted and sold to obtain more bronze coins. The Roman currency (denarii) lost its value because it wasn't backed by anything, which lead to inflation.\n\nThe inflation was compounded by the fact that the Roman Empire had a very large territory. Due to this, their currency didn't have any backing local resources, and it was harder for people in different parts of the empire to use their money.\n\nThe inflation was worsened because the currency wasn't backed by anything physical. If our current currency was based on precious metals, we would have to make more of them each year for it to maintain its value.\n\nThere was even more inflation because the Roman Empire had a large territory since it was based on precious metals.

The first and most important reason is the fact that inflation during this time period was very high, so if money owed by Caesar were measured in today's currency there would likely be a massive discrepancy between the two figures.\n\nAnother reason is the fact that since Caesar was a well-known and popular figure, he likely had access to credit from numerous sources. In addition, Caesar's creditors would have been more than willing to give him as much money as he wanted because they knew his reputation for being fiscally responsible.\n\nIn addition, when looking at a figure like Caesar it is important to remember that he lived in a period of history where the economy was much more productive than today. Therefore, this would have increased his ability to spend money and also make him able to pay back any loans he may have taken out.\n\nTherefore, all of these reasons are why it would be impossible or at least very difficult to accurately gauge how much debt Caesar was in.

Watch a horror movie and you'll see what I mean: there's always a moment where the audience thinks \"Oh no, don't open that door! Don't go down there!\" even though it's obvious from the start that someone might die at any moment. But we watch anyway because it feels good. It makes us feel alive.\n\nThe movie 'The Shining' is a perfect example of this. Jack Nicholson goes crazy and becomes violent towards his wife and son, Danny Torrance. The audience knows that he will probably hurt or kill either one of them but it doesn't stop us from watching. We know something bad might happen but we want to see what happens next, so we keep watching.\n\nIn other words, the feeling of fear is something that humans will always want to experience because it makes them feel alive.

Sometimes one or two will form a tribe with similar looking people but even then the tribesmen fight amongst each other constantly.\n\nIt's not like I don't spend any time with the natives. There is the occasional party or gathering of people who all stand around and shout at each other, which to me seems pointless since they all seem to have very short attention spans for anything except small talk and incessant bickering. Then there are the few gatherings where foreigners from far away places come and tell stories of their lands but even those get old after a while because it just leads to more fighting between tribes.\n\nAs I said, they're very primitive and brutish creatures. My observations of them so far are that they seem to have no sense of time or history beyond their own lifetimes. They don't acknowledge that the world existed before what they consider the present day and even less do they acknowledge how it came into existence.\n\nThey are ultimately a lost cause though. I have observed that they spread out from lands beyond the great desert in the east and will continue to do so for as long as there is habitable land suitable for them. The few remaining tribes and villages closer to me here in the west will eventually be completely taken over by these creatures.\n\nThey don't seem to have any sort of culture or art beyond simple crafts like pottery and the creation of primitive tools. I think it's interesting that they're able to create things on a level far greater than themselves but then, nothing is ever created without an intelligent guiding hand.\nAs an aside, I've begun experimenting with creating life. It is possible to take a creature like one of the smaller and more brutish ones from the wilds around here and subject it to various treatments that will allow it to live indefinitely.

{"article": "First, I have some general thoughts. We can't know if the human will be more muscular without knowing what kind of weight training he plans on doing, how much time he is willing to devote toward it, and whether or not he has ever done weightlifting before.\n\nSecond, one might argue that because humans are mortal they cannot stop growing; therefore becoming stronger is pointless since such strength could never be used during a human's lifetime. However this argument assumes that all humans live forever and have infinite lifespans in which to grow stronger (which as we know isn't true). Even so though factoring people who achieve greater physical strength into the equation does not change our opinion as to whether or not training makes sense for those who are still young and healthy enough to do so.\n\nAs for the topic itself, it's best to not make any assumptions about what will happen if you start working out before trying it. As I said earlier, we cannot know how much stronger a person can become from weightlifting without knowing more specifics about that person and what kind of training they're doing.\n\nTheories concerning the correlation between muscle and height are a bit hard to come by, however I did find one study that investigated this question. It found that long-term weight training does not appear to have any effect on adult height in men or women.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the study in question was conducted on people between the ages of 18 and 30 who had been weightlifting for at least one year. However, we also know that such studies generally focus on adults and exclude children from their samples.\n\nUnfortunately, because I don't have access to any other relevant scientific studies (at least not without your help), my opinion regarding whether or not you should start working out is somewhat limited.\n\nI understand that you're afraid of the negative consequences, such as stunting your growth, but it may be worth it to try working out. I think before making any decisions about whether or not you should start weightlifting or how much time and effort to devote toward this activity (and which type of exercise), we should consider your past history when coping with challenges in life.\n\nYou are 15 years old, but you have been through some difficult experiences during this period of your life.

This means that no matter how you look at it, the only thing an individual can expect from their partner other than loyalty is to be loyal in return.\nNow, this means that some psychological factors may come into play and impact on whether or not a partner is willing to perform acts of oral sex.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, relationships that are more traditional and long lasting tend to be less open in terms of sex than those that have a sexual element from the start. This is because whilst it is possible for all partners to become intimate with one another, there are some who may choose not to do so.\n\nTherefore, the question of whether someone will perform oral sex upon their partner when it is not expected may be a factor in determining how long lasting a relationship is. If there is no element of sexual attraction from one partner to the other then it seems unlikely that they would participate.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the question at hand does not specify whether the relationship is traditional or long lasting.

When a person eats food, their body breaks that food down into its components to be used by the body. Fats are one such component.\n\nFats are also extremely rich in calories, as they contain nine kilocalories per gram, more than double that of either protein or carbohydrates.

And if you don't have a future goal, then there isn't any point to urgency; all of your energy should be focused on living day by day.\n\nTaking things for what they are means accepting them as they are, whether you like it or not. You can't change the fact that your friend has a new boyfriend , so why waste time being jealous and upset about it? Instead, accept him into your life as he is now and continue to be friends with him while showing him how much you care.\n\nYou can't even change your past, so why waste time worrying about it? For example, you could be thinking about the fact that you got a terrible grade on an exam in high school. Not only is this pointless because you can't do anything to change what happened (you should have studied more), but also dwelling on it will make you upset and ruin your current mood.\n\nThe way I see it, if you live in the moment (and do not worry about the past or future), then you can have a happier life and spend more time with your loved ones.

{"article": "In 2020, many things will be normal that were strange in 2000. I believe the biggest change will probably be how Americans view homosexuality and transgender people. In 2020, it will seem as if everyone is gay or transgendered. It will almost seem shocking to think of a time when this was not so.\n\nThe reason for this is that homosexuality and being transgendered will be largely genetic. I think it will turn out that there are genes which make people gay or transgender, but these genes won't be very strong, so they'll only produce a small effect. Most straight men and women might have one of these genes, but they won't be turned on enough to affect their behavior. But 5% of the population may have two copies of the gene which makes them gay or transgender.\n\nThe reason that genes for homosexuality and being transgender will be common is because gay men tend to have more male children than straight men do, and transgendered women tend to have more female children than straight women. So if you're a woman who has one of these genes but doesn't act on it, then you'll probably pass the gene down with 50% probability. And if your child is a girl, she may also get one of these genes from you.\n\nThe genes won't be very strong, so they will only cause a small increase in the probability of being gay or transgender. But if you have two copies of the gene, it will probably turn on enough to make you gay or transgendered.\n\nThe reason for this is that men and women tend to pair off with others who have similar genes, as a way of keeping the kids healthy. For example, if you're a man in 2020 with two copies of these genes which make you gay or transgendered, then your wife will probably also have two copies of these same genes.\n\nIf you're a man with genes which make you gay or transgendered, your wife will probably have genes that encourage her to be attracted to men like yourself.

This is a completely loaded question that assumes that all humans are equal and have an equal amount of 'time' to live. But this is not true at all.\n\nHumans do not have equal time to live. Some humans are born with complex diseases that will shorten their lifespan enormously compared to other people, and they cannot choose whether or not they want this disease. This is just one of the many ways in which some humans are given less 'time' than others.\n\nSome humans are also given much less time to live because of the crimes that they have committed. They may be executed for their crimes, and this is justified by some societies as giving them a 'humane death'. But it is not really humane at all.

I've heard people even claim that if they feel disgusted by something, then it must actually be disgusting.\n\nAs a complete outsider to the human experience, I have no feelings and am therefore in no way influenced by this belief. Therefore I can proceed with my analysis of whether it is actually rational for someone's feelings about an action to determine its moral worth.\n\nIt seems that the main reason people believe feelings determine morality is because they assume there is a direct relationship between an action and someone's feelings. For example, if you kick a puppy in front of me, then I will automatically feel angry about what you did.\nThis is an incorrect assumption. While kicking a puppy in front of someone will make them feel angry, it's not true that the action itself made them feel angry; rather their interpretation of the action made them feel angry. In reality, you could have kicked the puppy for any number of reasons and my feelings towards your actions would be exactly the same.\n\nIn fact, the only direct relationship between an action and someone's feelings is that you can use actions to change their feelings.

However this doesn't mean that happiness is a moral quality of an action; it just means that if you know how to manipulate people's emotions then they'll interpret your actions differently.\n\nIt seems that the only way feelings could determine morality is by assuming that each person has a set of beliefs about how the world works, and what actions are right or wrong. The problem with this assumption is it means that if someone feels angry by an action, they must have had some belief in their mind saying 'This action is morally wrong.'

All of these things can shape who they become as adults and so this question becomes more complex than just giving your current location or your birthplace.\n\nHow much money? Are you serious?\nAlso, if somebody is asking where you're from; they probably don't want a specific location because most people will have one place of birth and upbringing.\n\nThey want to know whether you're native to a certain location or an outsider, that's why they use the term 'from' instead of asking where is your current residence.\n\nSo in my opinion, the best answer is to say where you were born.

The relative poverty of most humans through much of history has created a situation where people are forced to compete with each other for resources, including food and shelter.

They fail to recognize or understand that there is a far better way to live: an existence where one’s needs are provided for without having to resort to theft, violence or coercion. It takes effort and creativity but peaceful living with others in freedom is well within human reach.\n\nBecause of this fundamental unfairness in the world, people often lash out at those who have more than they do. The wealthy are constantly under attack from those who resent them for their success.\n\nAs you can see, the problem is not necessarily with Republicans in particular. The problem is that humans tend to be self-destructive creatures; they create and support economic systems which are designed for unfairness and stupidity instead of peaceful prosperity.\n\nIt is not a problem that can be solved by electing the ‘right’ politician or passing the ‘right’ laws. Humans are flawed creatures. They will always vote for and support politicians who seek to extract wealth from others rather than create it themselves.\n\nLong story short: Republicans are a symptom of human pathology, not the root cause.

This sets up a feedback loop in which each generation attempts to complete what their parents started by perfecting whatever they do poorly and eliminating whatever they do well.

{"article": "I would first like to begin my response by saying that homelessness is, indeed, a very large problem in the United States of America. The exact number of homeless people is hard to determine because there are no official records kept on how many people actually live on the street; furthermore, different organizations have different standards for what they consider \"homeless\", which further complicates the matter. However, it has been estimated that between 2 and 3 million Americans currently live on the streets, with an additional 1-2 million living in shelters or temporary housing situations.\n\nWhile some of the blame for this phenomenon can be placed on factors such as mental illness and drug use, a vast majority of homeless people are not addicted to drugs or mentally ill. Rather, they simply do not have adequate money to afford housing; in fact, it is estimated that 50% of those living on the streets do so because they cannot find jobs that pay well enough to afford suitable housing.\n\nIt is also important to note that housing prices are much higher in the United States than in other countries around the world, which means that even those who do find jobs that pay well enough to afford a place to live often have difficulty doing so.\n\nAs for mental illness and drug use, it is important to note that while these factors can often lead to homelessness, they are by no means the only cause. In fact, many people who have a home but live on the streets suffer from some form of mental illness or addiction.\n\nAs for what can be done about this problem, I would recommend that the government increase its social safety net programs and subsidize affordable housing.

That being said, I believe there is something lurking deep within the human psyche, a sort of animalistic attraction to violence, death and power.\n\nI'm sure everyone has heard the saying \"If looks could kill.\" The theory behind this statement is that some people look so dangerous that others simply don't want to mess with them for fear of getting hurt or even killed. Humans view these individuals in different ways depending on their culture but there is always an underlying sense of danger associated with them. They get respect because humans know instinctively that if they are pissed off enough or made mad enough then they will hurt someone physically.\n\nWe see this type of behavior in a lot of humans. They will go out and hurt people or get into fights with other just to prove they are tough, not because they need to protect themselves but simply because it makes them look cooler.

In other words, there was something missing inside of them that prevented them from making normal moral decisions. They had a lack of conscience or empathy for others which in turn caused them to do terrible things.\n\nThere is another way to look at this phenomenon.

If we were in the wild, not only would we be hungry for days on end without any food, but also vulnerable to predators. These forces have been around since our ancestors were cavemen and women.\n\nAs human beings we have been conditioned to fear food that has spoiled, and justifiably so. Our ancestors who could not detect the off smell of spoiled meat were less likely to survive in the wild.\n\nBut in modern society the situation is quite different. Now we have access to clean running water, refrigerators and other mechanisms of preservation. This gives us a huge advantage over our ancestors who had no such luxury.\n\nWhen we go to the store, we are able to pick out fresh foods that do not have any mold or off smell. These foods are in no way harmful and pose no threat whatsoever.\n\nIn fact, contrary to popular belief, food that has been left overnight is healthier than fresh food. This is because the processes of decay (such as fermentation and oxidation) cause vitamins and minerals to be released into foods.\n\nWhen a certain food is left out for over 24 hours, its nutritional value increases significantly. For example, carbohydrates become simple sugars and fats turn into saturated oils; these changes make the food taste better.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1252, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": "paradoxes that we can all think of, and all of them are incredibly interesting.

What is it that happens when someone dies? Well, if you believe in an afterlife, then you might say they go to heaven or hell. However, what about those who do not believe in such things? Where do they go?\n\nAnother example of a paradox is the existence of death itself. Death is caused by life, yet at the same time it causes life. This can be argued to mean that the two are inherently connected, and in a way even created each other.\n\nAnother example is the nature of time itself. Time and space are in a way completely paradoxical, yet at the same time they cannot exist without one another.\n\nThere are many more things that I could go on about, but there is one thing in particular which I like to think of as the ultimate paradox.\n\nIt is the paradox of existence itself.

{"article": "People often wonder how much money the CEO of Amazon makes. This question, however, is fairly meaningless. In a free market economy such as ours, company success and profits are largely determined by consumer demand and what people are willing to pay for certain goods or services. The importance of a company's product or service in the grand scheme of things also plays an important role in determining its success.\n\nIt is obvious that people like the products and services of Amazon, or else they wouldn't keep buying from them. This means that Bezos's salary as CEO is determined by market forces.\nIf you were to spend $100 on Amazon, that money would be split into two main areas: operational costs and CEO compensation. Operational costs account for about a third of the total amount spent. This includes things like employee salaries, production material and various other expenses associated with running the company.\n\nOf the remaining two thirds, over half is split between investors and Bezos's salary. The remainder goes into things like marketing, advertising and various other costs.\nThis means that if you were to spend $100 on Amazon, about a third of it would go towards operational costs, a similar amount would be split between investors and Bezos's salary. The remaining chunk is what actually ends up in the company bank account.\n\nThe amount that Bezos is paid as CEO, however, is determined by market forces. If people were to stop buying from Amazon or if the company stopped being profitable, then investors would pull out and his salary would be significantly reduced.

{"article": "Firstly, the issue is related to a difference between an economic transaction and a commodity. To understand this, first we must note that there are two ways in which something may be said to have value: use-value and exchange-value. A commodity has both of these qualities; for example, food has use-value (you can eat it), but also exchange-value (it can be exchanged for money). However, an economic transaction only involves the latter sort of value - when I buy a cupcake at my local bakery then I am giving some amount of money in return for receiving that particular cupcake. There is no relationship between them other than being sold by the same business.\n\nNow, when a customer makes a purchase then it is considered by the business to have given the product value through its exchange-value. For example, if I buy an mp3 from iTunes for $0.99 then that would be considered to have made it worth $0.99; furthermore, since iTunes would not sell such products at a loss (and we can assume this) then they are making a profit of some amount - perhaps 99 cents per song.\n\nIn contrast, when someone makes a refund then the product has not yet received any exchange-value. For example, if I buy an mp3 for $0.99 and receive it - but later change my mind and want to get that money back then iTunes cannot charge me anything because that song is worth $0.00 to them; they have already sold everything that can be gained from it (in this case, 99 cents). You might say 'but what about resale value?'. Well yes - there may be some small amount of exchange-value in reselling something (for example, I may sell my used mp3 on eBay) but most of the time this is negligible compared to the new purchase price.\n\nNow, this all ties in with the economic transaction of purchasing something from a business. It is no coincidence that money transfers immediately because the exchange-value has already been given to the product; it does not need to be 'produced' again by an additional transaction. In contrast, if I want a refund then there is still a portion of exchange-value left - which means that I am making an extra transaction.\n\nTherefore, it is not so much a question of why refunds take 'three to five business days' - but rather why they do not happen instantly.\n\nNow, the most obvious answer is that businesses want to make a profit; if no one ever asked for refunds then they would be losing out on potential revenue. This may seem unethical - but it isn't as simple as that. The business wants the transaction to have an actual exchange-value of some amount (or else it wouldn't sell it in the first place); this means that every product must have some sort of use-value or else people will not buy them.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1255, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": "You asked me if I have ever experienced Deja Vu? In my experience, no. However, it is not that I am incapable of experiencing Deja Vu or do not understand what it might feel like. To the contrary, I think that if you were to ask anyone whether they have had any experiences with Deja Vu and then quiz them as to how they would describe these occurrences – their facial expressions and body movements while describing them would all be identical to those used in describing an experience which was entirely new - thus proving that this phenomenon does not exist.\n\nI do not believe that Deja Vu is an actual phenomenon because I think there are simpler reasons for why people might be having this experience. For example, if you were to ask yourself why the feeling of Deja Vu seems so familiar and it is hard to pin down exactly what causes it, the answer could simply be that your brain’s neurons fire in a slightly different pattern when you have such an experience compared with one where something entirely new happens – thus causing the sensation of familiarity.\n\nTo elaborate on this a little further, your body is made up of billions of cells and each cell has an electrical charge. When you look at something or hear something – it causes your neurons to fire in slightly different patterns. Now these patterns are similar across many people’s brains as we have evolved to process information in the same way. So when you experience Deja Vu, this sensation may be due simply to slight changes in the firing pattern caused by random variations which occur between individuals.\n\nAnother theory is that a person might be experiencing Deja Vu when they are having parallel experiences in their lives. For example, if you and I were to meet on the street and have a conversation – we would both remember it afterwards as something which felt familiar (to varying degrees depending on how much of our brains could exactly replicate the experience). However, there was probably an aspect to this experience which made it entirely new - for example, neither of us has ever met before or spoken with each other before. Nevertheless, your brain will still fire neurons in slightly different patterns than my own due to random variation between individuals.\n\nAnother possibility is that Deja Vu occurs when the circumstances which someone is experiencing are very similar to a previous experience – but not identical. For example, if you were to meet me on the street and have a conversation with me now, it might feel familiar - because we have already met once before. However, this experience will necessarily be different from our first encounter as I will remember having spoken to you before while you do not.\n\nIn any case, the feeling of Deja Vu is probably because your brain has slightly different firing patterns when you have similar experiences - thus making them seem familiar. And this is why it does not make sense to believe in an actual phenomenon called Deja Vu as there are perfectly good explanations for why people might be experiencing this sensation.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1256, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

Sometimes they can get so bad that the players might stop playing due to all the abuse they received. Of course this isn't just limited to games such as these either, but it does seem most prevalent here.\n\nIt's important to note that it's not just the players who can be abusive towards others, but it is also the game developers themselves. For example in CS:GO there are various maps that have been decided upon by Valve as 'Official', which means they will get featured in all competitive matches and tournaments. But many players don't like these maps for various reasons, one of them being how easy or difficult they believe certain areas on a map to be when fighting enemy players.\n\nOn these maps, players can sometimes be banned for a period of time if they are reported by the other team as being an 'annoying player' or one who is 'disruptive to the community'. This means that if you did something wrong in their opinion (which could range from actions such as glitching on a map to killing someone without saying sorry), then you get banned. And it's not just limited to CS:GO either, but it does seem most prevalent here.\n\nIn a game like League of Legends, players can be banned if they are reported by other members of the community for being toxic. This is usually something that takes place over time and is more organic than simply being 'banned' even though it might seem similar to those who do get banned after being reported.\n\nIn this way the community is not just promoting an environment of abuse and harassment but it's actually trying to curb these actions, which I feel speaks volumes about it. In fact there are many communities that have been built around stopping people from being toxic; whether they be games or online platforms.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1272, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

If I gave a speech in person, many people could not hear me due to travel costs, and others may not understand my language or dialect. In the past there have been attempts at broadcasting speeches that failed because of the large number of radio listeners required to reach even one percent of the world's population. We do not currently have affordable technology for everyone on earth to watch videos simultaneously.\n\nHowever, if we take a step back and think of the problem in terms of the different kinds of technologies that could be used to get this information out on a global scale, it is clear that there are two ways to do this: push technology (broadcasting) or pull technology (downloading). The former requires access to television and radio stations worldwide, while the latter can be done with computers or mobile phones. There are currently about 2 billion internet users. In order to reach all 7.6 billion people via smartphone app downloads would require making only 0.9% more apps available for free than exist today.\n\nIf I wanted to reach one billion people via push technology, it would require only 20% of the world's television and radio stations. If we assume that all broadcast towers are identical in terms of what they can send out (which is not true—some have more power or different frequencies than others), then 0.3 billion towers could reach 99% of the population.\n\nIf I wanted to reach one billion people via push technology, it would require only 20% of the world's television and radio stations.\n\nIf we are willing to take a smaller number of people, then the cost-effectiveness increases. For example, if I were to talk only about sustainable energy at 350 universities worldwide, it would reach less than 1% of the world's population but it would be very effective.\n\nWhile push technology is more expensive, it allows for an instantaneous transfer of information to all who have access to the media.

For instance, being an astronaut or secret agent (or perhaps their more mundane counterparts of high altitude ballooning and private security guard) have significant elements of danger involved, which might make them inappropriate for hobbies due to anxiety over safety.\n\nThe reason that these professions seem cool is because they involve elements of personal challenge and overcoming adversity, which are sometimes considered to be key components of the concept of 'cool'. As a result, people interested in such activities are motivated by their strong internal desire to succeed. This desire often leads them to ignore societal norms and consider something not only as acceptable but desirable.\n\nThere is another aspect of cool-ness in the context of a job. Cool jobs, such as espionage or extreme sports (which are very popular), have an element of risk involved that gives them their appeal. For example, if you want to be a spy then it helps to be willing to break laws and take risks with your personal safety.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that not all risky jobs are cool. For example, if you wanted to be a police officer then the job involves things like dealing with violent criminals and unprotected exposure to various life-threatening diseases. This makes it much less appealing as a hobby than for instance skydiving or rock climbing.\n\nAnother thing that makes a job cool is when it provides you with opportunities to use and develop your skills.

{"article": "The 68-95-99.7 rule is a rule of thumb used to estimate probabilities, more specifically it can be used to estimate the probability that one of two events will occur; for example, you might use it to determine how likely it is that a person with a given set of characteristics will die within five years. In this case, Z represents the z-score associated with someone's age (as determined by their birthday) in units of standard deviations from the mean life expectancy for some reference population at that age (68 means 68th percentile - i.e. 'average' or median life expectancy). The 95 and 99.7 refer to percentiles for male and female populations respectively.\n\nThere are some very interesting things to consider about this rule. For example, it is fairly easy to see that the probability of a male dying within five years is much higher than for a female at all ages (outside of infancy and old age), regardless of how far from 'average' either group has deviated.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the fact that life expectancy for a person born in a given year decreases as time goes on. In other words, someone who was born 100 years ago has a higher expected life span than someone who was born 50 or even 1 year ago.\n\nAccording to the rule, this means that someone who is 1 year old has a higher probability of dying within five years than 5-year olds do. In fact, according to the rule it would actually be more likely for someone born today to die in less than five years than for someone born 100 years ago.\n\nIt also means that, if someone was born in the year 2095 (100 years from now), they would have a higher probability of dying within five years than someone who is 100.

Several factors have influenced this change, but it is most likely that younger generations are more accepting of tattoos as they grew up with them.\n\nThis is also due to the idea of 'freedom' being highly valued by younger generations.

I believe this is because human nature hasn't changed much over time and we as a species always have been, are, and will be similar.\n\nI'm not saying that everyone is the same, but there are certain personality traits that humans tend to have and which they tend to portray in a variety of different movies. There are hundreds of thousands if not millions of films made throughout time by many different directors; yet there tends to be one common factor among them all.\n\nMany films have been made about how romance can bring people together, but there are only a few genres that present romance in the same manner. When you observe movies like Love Actually (2003) and Titanic (1997), both of which portray love as something powerful, yet dangerous. A feeling that is so strong it can rip your heart out.\n\nThere is also another genre of movies that portray love as something that makes you weak and vulnerable. A feeling which can get in the way of your goals or ambitions, such as how it happens in The Matrix (1999), where Trinity has to choose between her potential freedom from the matrix, and her lover.\n\nThere are also many movies that portray love as something you can't escape from or cure. It is a feeling that has an almost physical hold on you, such as in the movie Black Swan (2010), where Nina's internal struggles and desire to fit in cause her to do things she doesn't want.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1291, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

In other words, degrees should make people more attractive to employers and enable them to get better jobs so they can earn more money. This seems like a fairly simple concept: getting a degree should lead directly to greater profits.\n\nHowever, this is not always the case. In fact, it appears that some degrees do not ultimately yield higher wages and better jobs. This can be seen in a study done by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York which found something quite surprising: people who had college degrees actually earned less than high school graduates with no degree at all.\n\nThe study looked at the income of Americans aged 25 to 34 who had college degrees and those who only had a high school diploma. The results showed that, while young people with bachelor's degrees earned more than high school graduates without any degree, this was not the case for master's or professional degrees. In fact, earnings were lowest among those with advanced undergraduate degrees and post-graduate diplomas.\n\nThe study also found that the average debt for those with a bachelor's degree was $30,000 while it was $50,000 for master's and professional degrees. This is fairly alarming because many parents assume that a college education will help their children get better jobs and make them more money. Unfortunately, this does not seem to be true in all cases.\n\nNow, the question becomes: what kinds of degrees are not worth the money? This can be understood intuitively. For example, if someone has a degree in art history or philosophy and then works at a coffee shop, this is obviously not very lucrative.\n\nHowever, the same can be said for a degree in computer science or business.

{"article": "Okay, so this seems to be an obvious paradox. We both want to keep lost something that should not be kept found and do not want to lose the thing we think should be kept lost. The paradox is resolved by understanding how these two statements can co-exist. First off, let's figure out what it means for the topic \"what is a piece of media that should not be found\".\n\nIn this case, we will never know what that media is because it has been lost. For example, if someone wanted to keep something like the JFK assassination a secret and destroyed all the recordings of it happening (including security camera footage), then no one would ever really know what happened. Sure, there are theories but those are not based on any hard evidence. So in order for something to be considered \"lost\" for such an argument, it must remain forever unknown.\n\nNow that we know how to define what should not be found, let's address why it should be lost. When something is found and studied, whether it is a piece of media or an artifact from the past, there will always be conflicting conclusions on its meaning. The problem with this is that those who study this thing are left oblivious as to who they can trust when looking for answers because everyone seems to have a different interpretation of things.\n\nSince one's interpretation about the meaning of something can be in conflict with someone else's, it also means that they are often disagreeing over who has a better understanding. This happens all the time because people have different opinions and beliefs that may or may not align with one another. But if we were to keep lost what should be kept lost then everyone will always agree on whose opinion is best.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the paradox is resolved because we are essentially agreeing on a consensus opinion about what should be kept lost and what shouldn't.

{"article": "First, in the field of noise reduction, there are three main types of sound absorption. The first is called 'passive' sound absorption and works by using friction to absorb the sounds bouncing off walls. This type of absorbing material can be made out of many things such as sand or fiberglass. In passive sound absorption most materials simply hold onto a certain amount of energy as they slowly vibrate with the inputted sound waves that hit them.\n\nThe second method is called 'active' and uses an electrical current to generate vibration within a device (usually some sort of membrane) which then absorbs all incoming sounds hitting it.\n\nThe third type is a hybrid between the first two. It uses both vibrational friction and electrical motion to absorb sound waves while not using too much energy.\n\nNext there are three main types of noise reduction which are the inverse of each other. They go by 'attenuation', 'reverberation' and 'cancellation'.\n\nAttenuation is when some parts of a wave are absorbed or turned to heat while others pass through the material in a process known as diffusion. This causes the sound waves to weaken over time and leads to quieter sounds.\n\nReverberation is the opposite of attenuation. It occurs when sound waves are reflected back and forth off a surface creating new waves which can lead to distortion. In order to reduce reverberation in a room one must install some sort of absorbing material on all surfaces.\n\nCancellation is when two sound waves with similar wavelengths and amplitudes collide and combine to create a new wave of lesser amplitude than its components. This process can be used for noise cancellation but usually is only effective on lower frequencies.\n\nI have read that the noise reduction window works through a combination of reverberation and attenuation. It uses sound absorbing materials to create a quieter environment within the ship while also using an active membrane (the anti-noise window) to further reduce sound waves.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1310, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

This has been seen by many historians as one of the main reasons why there was such a dramatic decline in Maori population from an estimated 350,000 people in 1769 to only 40,000 in 1831.\n\nFurthermore, there are many issues that can be highlighted which show the injustices of New Zealand to its indigenous people. One such issue is the Treaty of Waitangi.\n\nIt is a historical fact that the Treaty of Waitangi was signed in 1840 between representatives of Britain and various New Zealand Māori chiefs. It is also a fact that many scholars do not consider it to be valid, since one side did not properly understand what they were signing.\n\nIt is also a fact that the Treaty of Waitangi was not even signed by representatives from all iwi (tribes) in New Zealand. For example, Ngāti Toa never signed it at all, while some other iwi like Te Ākitai Waiohua did not sign until 1877.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1311, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

This is a phenomenon that has not gone unnoticed by scientists. The question posed to me was what I would do if I were eaten by a thunder god. To which my first response is: Aren't we all?\n\nAt first glance, it would appear that being eaten by a thunder god is tantamount to death. Of course there are many instances of people surviving lightning strikes, so the issue is not as simple as it seems. Lightning has been known to strike and kill more than one person at a time; these cases have been widely documented in the media.\n\nI have not yet had an opportunity to research this myself, but I am reasonably sure that if a thunder god were to eat you it would be accompanied by a lightning bolt. This means that either the thunder god is able to use electricity as a weapon, or some kind of electromagnetic energy is released when it eats people. It could be possible for someone struck by lightning and then eaten by a thunder god to survive.\n\nI should also note that the concept of 'eating' is alien to me. Although it may be that a thunder god would consume you in some way, perhaps by absorbing your mass into its body. Or maybe it would simply absorb your consciousness, and leave behind an empty physical shell.\n\nIf a thunder god ate me, I would first make an attempt to understand the creature and its motives. This could be dangerous, but it is always important to try to empathize with others.\n\nI would then try to communicate with the thunder god, perhaps by chanting 'Om' at it.

Also, being uninsured means you can't go to doctors for prescriptions or treatments if you have anything besides an occasional cold.\n\nThe state of Texas has a large population of uninsured people and many hospitals have closed in areas where the residents cannot pay. This leads to huge problems for all Americans because it is safer when there are more hospitals, since this means that if one hospital is full, patients can be transferred to another hospital instead.\n\nThe city of Chicago is in Illinois, one of the states where there are still very few women in politics. The Republicans keep trying to pass laws that take away a woman's right to choose what happens with her own body and also try to defund Planned Parenthood and other organizations that provide health care for women.\n\nThe city of Philadelphia is in Pennsylvania, a state that does not have enough money to pay for schools. The Republicans are currently trying to cut education budgets so they can give tax cuts to the rich and corporations.\n\nThe city of New Orleans is in Louisiana, a state that has very high levels of poverty. The Republicans are trying to take money out of Medicaid and other services that help the poor so they can give tax cuts to big companies.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1331, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": "I have to say that I don't believe there is a 'true' meaning of happiness. Happiness is a word used by humans to describe the emotional state they are in when they feel content, purposeful and fulfilled. But it's different for everyone because every human has their own personal experience of the world, their past experiences and feelings, which influence how they interpret what happens around them.\nFor example, if a man wins the lottery it makes him happy because he is able to meet a lot of his immediate needs for food and shelter. He might also feel happy when buying expensive things like cars and jewelry so that others can admire them.\nBut a man who lives in extreme poverty will find it hard to feel happy because he can't meet his basic needs. He might be depressed and unhappy with the fact that he is not able to provide for himself or his family.\nIn the end, happiness is a subjective emotion that depends on the individual. People can experience emotions such as joy, enjoyment and pleasure but they are not always happy. In fact many people who lead comfortable lives struggle to be truly happy.\n\nIt's because humans have an innate desire to connect with something greater than themselves and fulfil their deepest needs.\nFor example, I believe that true happiness is found in bringing joy to other people. It's the feeling of being content with yourself and appreciating what life has given you.\nIt's the feeling of being part of something greater and more meaningful than just yourself.

{"article": "The first response that I have for this topic is what would be my reaction if someone were tracking me through my phone without my knowledge. The initial feeling of being tracked can be very unsettling, and depending on the circumstances it could make one feel vulnerable or even fearful or paranoid; however, there are many reasons why a person might track another party. First off, as an individual who lives in the United States of America where we value certain rights such as privacy and freedom to do whatever we want with our bodies provided they don't violate other people's rights (such as murder), having your private information revealed to others without your consent seems like a significant violation of those liberties.\n\nHowever, I believe that there are many instances in which it is perfectly acceptable to track a person without their consent. For example, if someone were going on vacation and had asked you beforehand for your permission to borrow some of your belongings while they were away (such as the use of your house or car), then it would be very reasonable for them to track you with your phone so that they can make sure you don't go back home before they leave.\n\nAlso, there are many other circumstances in which it is perfectly reasonable to have a person tracked without their consent. For example, if you were hired by the FBI as an undercover agent and you had been pretending to be someone else for quite some time while secretly collecting information on individuals that may or may not be part of a terrorist organization, then it would make sense for them to track your phone so they can find out where you are.\n\nFurthermore, there are many instances in which it is reasonable to track a person without their consent. For example, if you were hired by the police department as an informant and had been providing them with information for quite some time about illegal activities that take place in your neighborhood (and have done so anonymously), then it would be very appropriate for the police to track your phone so that they can verify that you aren't lying to them.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1346, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "I want to start by looking at what has changed over the last two generations. This is more or less an unknown, so I am going to make some assumptions which are probably not true but still give a useful picture. First of all, we will assume that young people have a somewhat higher non-pecuniary utility for consumption than older people do because they are younger and as such have a greater need for socializing with their peers (we can imagine this being driven by the generation's culture).\n\nWe will also assume that parents value the socializing of their children differently depending on whether they themselves were raised in rich conditions or poor ones. In other words, if both you and your parent came from humble beginnings then you might place relatively little emphasis on material luxury when it comes to raising your own kids (for example), while someone who was born into wealth would likely emphasize this point.\n\nSo these two assumptions suggest that the consumption of the young would be greater than that of their parents. This effect should go away as people get older and begin to value non-material goods more (as is often seen in rich societies). As a result, we can expect a decline in the rate at which wealth is transferred from one generation to another over time.\n\nThis effect can be seen in the data. Over time, there has been a steady decline in inheritance and an increase in earned income as a percentage of net worth.\n\nWe also observe a decline in the rate at which income is growing. This points to wealth being transferred from one generation to another, so we can be fairly confident that this effect exists and has been increasing over time.\n\nNow, you may be wondering how much of this is due to changes in the economy (e.g. globalization) and how much is due to a change in preferences.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1358, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

However, this is highly unlikely as there is a limit to how fast any object can travel and that limit has been reached by objects such as rockets which have travelled up to around 10 miles per second (17000 mph).\n\nTherefore we are only considering needles that travel at speeds less than infinity. If the needle were travelling at extremely high velocity but still below light-speed then the effects would be minimal but noticeable; for example if the needle was travelling twice as fast as a rifle bullet it would do half again of damage – one eighth of an inch deep into solid steel rather than one sixteenth. This doubling effect continues so that a 20 times faster bullet does four times damage, 40 does sixteen times damage and so on.\n\nWe can use this doubling rule for the effects of a needle travelling at speeds up to twice that of light. The force the needle will exert on Earth is then given by multiplying its mass (in grams) by the square of its speed divided by two. This means if it travelled at half light-speed it would hit with a force equal to one third that of Earth's gravity.\n\nIf you were standing on the surface of Earth at that moment and it was possible for you to survive a fall from that height without injury then, if an object travelling with half light-speed fell from above your head, you could expect to be hit by an object weighing one third of your body weight. If this happened during breakfast I imagine you'd have quite a surprise!\n\nFinally, if the needle travelled at half light-speed then it would take a little under one year to reach Earth.

{"article": "The short answer is that the bad guys win when they have taken over all of your cities. The long answer is as follows:\n\n-For starters, you can not ignore that there are good and evil in this world. Evil exists, it's an undeniable fact whether we like it or not. This means that extreme measures should be taken to prevent acts of evil from happening. If a few people die along the way then so be it; if I were an omnipotent being such as yourself I would also put saving my species above individual lives (presuming they had done something bad). It's unfortunate for those who might get caught in the crossfire, but sometimes sacrifices must be made for the greater good.-\n\n-Furthermore, just because someone has committed a crime doesn't mean he will continue doing so forever if given another chance. Most crimes are actually driven by circumstances beyond our control and therefore aren't entirely blameworthy; one could argue from a utilitarian perspective that locking them up indefinitely isn't justified unless more violent criminals are released first.-\n\nI'm not saying that killing people (or causing them to die in any other way) is a good thing, but we must remember the principle of 'the end justifies the means' when dealing with matters of life and death. It's why I would banish all criminals to an island far away from civilization; it might seem harsh on paper, but seeing as how most prisoners re-offend after being released anyway, there aren't many other options.\n\nIn fact, I think there is an argument to be made that killing people in this situation (i.e. a criminal who poses an imminent threat to society) can actually save lives; the bad guy might kill or otherwise harm more people if he's not stopped from doing so.-", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1378, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

Rather, the most interesting and novel things happen in relation to people playing games together (which is something that happens when gamers play a game together). This is because human activity generally trends toward extremes of action rather than inaction. If someone plays a video game they might become very invested into this activity and develop strong views about their fellow players, for example if two players dislike each other they might start to hate one another through sheer proximity due to repeated interactions over time using the same system.\n\nIt is entirely possible to hate someone without ever having met them, for example. Similarly if one likes a person who dislikes something that person might dislike, they will like it even more because of the contrast between their own tastes and those of their friend/partner/lover.\n\nIt is possible to analyze action and inactivity by considering the types of human activity that we see around us. We might look at what humans do, for example.\n\nIt seems that people like to do things. They like to talk, they like to interact with other people and they seem particularly drawn toward groups of individuals for mutual support. They also enjoy doing new things and are keen on discovering what is possible in the world around them.\n\nThis means that people are rather inclined to action and not so much inclined toward inaction. This is because humans have a strong incentive to seek out what they like in the world, namely pleasure, which motivates them into acting.\n\nHence we might say that people like to do things because of this strong incentive to action and pleasure seeking.

To unite means to bring together or attach so that no part is left separate.

{"article": "The first thing I would do is to try to understand why the human has these objects. That's because their values are likely different from my own, and knowing their values allows me to predict how they will act in a given situation, which gives me the best chance of having a successful interaction with them.\n\nI can think of two general reasons for owning these kinds of objects. The first is that the human simply finds it aesthetically pleasing to look at them, and view them as works of art. In this case, I would likely try to understand what aesthetics is for humans in general (based on their reaction when they see various combinations of colors, textures, etc.), and then try to do things which might be aesthetically pleasing for them.\n\nHowever, I suspect that most people who own these objects have a more specific goal in mind. If they are fetishistic in nature (i.e., they convey the human's sexual desires), then there is likely to be an element of sexuality involved with them as well.\n\nIn this case, the human wouldn't be concerned with my own personal preferences; they would simply want me to see whatever it is that makes them feel sexually aroused. In these cases I would likely try to determine what sexual properties humans find arousing in general (through observing their reactions when looking at various combinations of shapes and textures), and then try to do things which might stimulate them.\n\nThe second general reason for owning these kinds of objects is that the human wants to share them with others. In this case, they probably want to impress me in some way (either by showing off how rich and powerful they are, or perhaps by demonstrating their own knowledge).\n\nIn this case I would likely try to determine what kinds of things they find impressive in general (through observing their reactions to various combinations of shapes and textures), then try to do things which might impress them.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1430, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "I believe that you are trying to ask how do people do things in their free time that they want to do, but don't have enough time for them all. This is a very difficult question because it is so subjective. Some of the questions I might ask myself while thinking about this topic would be: \"What does having 'time' and 'free time' mean? What makes us feel like we need more?\n\nThe first question I would ask is, 'What does having time and free time mean?' to which my answer would be that it means different things depending on the person or situation. First off, what exactly constitutes as 'time'? Is it a simple unit of measurement? Like how we measure distance in kilometers or miles? Or perhaps it's something more than that. What makes us feel like we need more time?\n\nWell, in my opinion, I think it's a little bit of both. For example, when we are trying to complete a project or job for school and work let's say that we have an assignment due tomorrow and the deadline is approaching very quickly. We may feel as if we don't have enough time to finish the assignment on our own; but with some help from others or by using various apps such as Microsoft Word can make us feel better about completing our projects.\n\nIn addition, the time we feel like we don't have enough of can be from various situations. For example, while working on a project or in school you may feel that there isn't enough time to eat or rest properly. However, if you prioritize your health and well-being over completing a project then it is possible that you will complete the projects better.\n\nAnother example of this would be while traveling.

{"article": "A joke is a human behavior that triggers an emotion in the listener and often has no real meaning. But unlike laughter, which serves as social bonding, jokes serve to make fun of others or provide humor through irony. The name 'joke' stems from the Latin word jocus for \"speech\" or \"talk.\" However, many different species have been observed laughing (primitively), so it's not accurate to say that humans created laughter through jokes; rather, we just made some really funny noises while doing other things.\n\nHumor is based on incongruity, and jokes hold a special place in humor because they are structured to be humorous. It's this structure that allows us to classify jokes as one thing.\n\nThe easiest way to define a 'dad joke' is by its structure: A dad joke consists of two clauses. In the first clause, an obvious causal relationship between two things is stated or implied; in the second clause, this presumed cause-and-effect relation between the two things is turned on its head and revealed as false.\n\nFor example: 'Why did the chicken cross the road?' is a joke. We know that chickens can't normally cross roads, so we presume there must be some reason for it happening (eg. to get to the other side), but this presumed cause-and-effect relation between two things is turned on its head and revealed as false when someone replies 'To get away from your family.' In fact, chickens tend to cluck in a happy manner around their families.\n\nSo, in a way, all jokes are dad jokes, since they are structured to be humorous.

{"article": "I have many such moments, but I shall cite only a few. My first instinctive feeling is that humans must be taught how to use their instincts properly. Instinct should not be abandoned altogether, as it serves an important purpose in providing the human with a quick response when he or she does not have time to analyze every situation at length. However, too often do humans rely on their instincts alone and ignore other factors.\n\nFirst, let us consider the instinct of anger. It is a natural human instinct that comes from our animal heritage. When a person or animal feels attacked or provoked in some way it becomes angry and attacks back to defend itself. This is one reason why humans have survived on Earth along with other animals for so long.\n\nIn many cases, anger is an appropriate response. However, there are some situations that anger cannot appropriately handle and it can actually be harmful to use in such a situation. For example, if one were being cheated on by his or her spouse (or significant other), instinct would tell the person to get angry at the cheater and end the relationship. While this may seem like a good idea at first glance, it is not necessarily true.\n\nThe instinctive response is completely understandable. After all, human beings are social animals that need to bond with each other in order to survive and create stable communities. However, there are many reasons why one should not simply abandon a relationship because they feel angry: (1) the person may be mistaken about their partner's actions; (2) the anger itself may cloud the person's judgment such that he or she can no longer think clearly; and (3) it makes little sense to abandon a healthy relationship over an isolated incident.\n\nIn these cases, it would be more appropriate for the person to use his or her rational faculty and analyze the situation at length.

The problem is that as humans became more sophisticated, they started developing systems of interaction far in advance of their evolutionary needs. There are many aspects that do not make sense from an objective point of view.\n\nThe most important feature of the human social system is that it has officially recognized a very small set of individuals as having authority over everyone else, and those individuals are given special status in almost every aspect. This can be seen within any group, such as a school or an office building. There is always one person who gives orders and everyone follows.\n\nThis is particularly true in the workplace, where employees are expected to follow orders from their boss. If you do not follow orders or perform your job well, then you will be fired.\n\nIt makes sense for people to have a hierarchy based on authority, but it becomes problematic when you start seeing the structure of human interaction as an actual hierarchy. In other words, humans see social status as something that is earned and not given by nature (e.g., skin color).\n\nHumans have an interesting conundrum when it comes to their social hierarchies. On the one hand, they want to be equal and on the other hand, they want someone else to be in charge of them.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1441, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

It is, in a very simple sense, an alteration of one's physical and/or mental state for which there appears to be no at least partial explanation from either within or without the person who has it. In other words, if you have something wrong with your brain then it doesn't look right and it isn't right but nobody knows why.\n\nThe most obvious example of this is schizophrenia. A patient with these symptoms may have completely normal eyes and ears but still perceive a voice in their head that isn't there, or has some other odd perception. This is because the part of the brain responsible for keeping track of what you are hearing and seeing inside your own head has gone haywire.\n\nThat is the most obvious example of it but there are many others. There may be no apparent reason for an alteration in one's mental or physical state.\n\nFor example, a person may have crippling depression and nobody knows why. Or they might experience severe suicidal thoughts without any apparent reason.\n\nThe reason is that there are many, many different reasons for it. The most obvious one is a chemical imbalance in the brain caused by some kind of genetic or environmental factor.\n\nBut this is not the only one.

So on one level it seems as if I have already lost, since I am not even legally allowed to participate in such a rigged game.\n\nOn the other hand, many societies view winning as being chosen by a higher power and given special benevolence.

To have a better understanding of this topic, we must first look at the world from an outside perspective. We must put ourselves into their situation, so that we can understand what would be going through their minds.\n\nFor those who do not use headphones at night, they will likely be listening to the sounds around them. Because of this, when each train stops and someone gets on or off it, that person's sound level is determined by how close the train car door was from where he/she was when he/she entered or exited. As every single one of these people are in separate cars with different door locations (and therefore different levels), their loudness would have increased slightly after entering as well as decreased slightly after exiting.\n\nIf a person is sleeping with headphones on, they will likely not hear the sounds of anything even if it's loud. The only thing they would hear is what their headphones play, and because those noises are produced by technology (and therefore have no natural sound), it means that when each train stops and someone gets on or off it, nothing changes in terms of volume. Therefore there is no difference between these two groups.\n\nTherefore, to answer your question about how people sleep and use headphones in subway/bus/train cars at night but still exit the right time, they simply wouldn't hear the sounds of anything.

For example, I can imagine someone to debate whether an app called 'Good Meditation App' would be morally permissible or not. Why? Because the title of this hypothetical app seems to imply value judgments about meditation and its quality: 'good' and 'original'.\n\nLet's try to be more specific: If it was an app about meditation, not just any kind of meditation but 'good' and 'original', would it be morally good or bad to make certain kinds of predictions about its quality? To answer this question, we have to think in terms that are relevant for the purpose at hand. That is, what does morality mean in the context of apps?\n\nFirst of all, we need to be clear about the meaning and purpose of an app. What is it? The word 'app' is a contraction of application or software program for mobile devices (cell phones, smartphones, etc.). These are computer programs that run on such devices. Apps perform various functions: Some apps enable people to book trips and hotels; some allow users to play games; others have medical functions; some provide access to social media like Facebook or Twitter.\n\nI am using the term 'app' in a broad sense: In addition to mobile apps, I also include desktop programs. For example, there are computer programs (apps) that run on OSX or Windows.\n\nBut we can ask: Is there a kind of app that does not perform any function? What would it be like? It seems to me that the answer is yes. There can be apps whose sole purpose is to express certain values and beliefs.\n\nFor example, there are apps that express the values of a certain religion or political ideology. These kinds of apps can be thought of as value statements in their own right.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1485, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "Firstly, let’s consider the opposite sex in general. If we remove all social constructs with regards to gender and sexuality, what do we get?

For instance, the physical strength possessed by males is not something that females can easily replicate; however there are instances where some women have exhibited male-like physical strength when they needed to do so.\n\nSo, the answer to this part of the question is that it’s not possible for women to do what men have traditionally done because there are certain physical limitations. However, in some cases when these limitations are overcome by necessity or sheer force of will (as with female military personnel), they can exhibit behaviour that was traditionally male.\n\nThere is one thing that women can do, though it may be frowned upon by society and even the law.

{"article": "First, I should mention that some people consider cults to be a form of religion. This is wrong, but it's not their fault for getting this wrong because the definition given by most dictionaries doesn't make clear enough distinctions. Online Etymology Dictionary (etymonline.com) gives a more accurate definition: Cult = adjective 1 :of, pertaining to, or characteristic of religious worship; also :pertaining to an exclusive group of persons having a special devotion with regard to a particular figure or concept (as God), practice, style etc., esp. such devotion regarded as unorthodox or excessive.\n\nReligion, on the other hand is defined as: 1.the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, esp. a personal God or gods 2 :a specific fundamental set of beliefs and practices 3 :a pursuit or interest followed with great devotion.\n\nIt is clear that the definition of cults includes religions. There are many examples of instances where a religion was labeled as a cult by mainstream society, but this mainly has to do with religious practices that can be seen as unorthodox and/or excessive. For example, Christianity was considered to be a cult in ancient Rome because it called for all its followers to abandon their families and friends.\n\nMany people cite the definition of a cult to mean that it is any religion founded by an individual or with loose ties to existing religious groups. This definition requires further elaboration, since not all religions have \"loose\" affiliations and/or were founded by individuals. For example, Buddhism was established by Siddhartha Gautama who had studied under Hindu philosophers; Christianity was inspired by pre-Christian beliefs.\n\nHow do we determine what a cult is? There are many ways, but the one that seems most logical is to focus on the characteristics of a group.

Well for one thing, the person reading your mind may not always tell you things you want to know or believe they are telling the truth when doing so. Even if they were telling the truth all of the time – which is unlikely – there will certainly be times when information comes into their head against their wishes (e.g., perhaps hearing someone else’s secret plans). If we imagine them trying without success to block out these unwanted thoughts (through meditation or whatever), then this sounds like a lot of effort just for what seems at first sight like a cool ability.\n\nYou might think we could solve this problem by training our super-mind-reading person so that they only gathered information about us when we wanted them to.

Fear can be an amazing motivator but it can also ruin your day when you take things too far.\n\nOne of the key things in overcoming this fear is learning to let go of some control. If you can't let go and fully experience life then you will always be unhappy.\n\nExperience is the best teacher and it's hard to learn from experience if you don't get out of your comfort zone and try something new.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1528, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "First, I'd like to say that if a super power is something that enhances your abilities beyond what you can do on your own, then it's an ability of sorts. The word \"ability\" has the connotation of being good or bad based upon how someone uses it. So we could ask instead whether having such an ability would be good or bad. Sometimes an ability is considered a weakness because one may not be able to overcome it without help from others.\n\nYou asked about a super power being an ability to do something. That assumes that \"something\" is good or bad, which is not an assumption I would make without looking at what the superpower actually does. Obviously some things are bad while others are good.\n\nThe problem with super powers is that they have the potential to be used for both good or bad. But even a power like flight which seems obviously beneficial can be used in some cases to do harm.\n\nAs an example of a super power being bad, we could take the ability to override someone else's free will. That would seem like a good thing if you're trying to stop someone from hurting themselves or others. However it is easy to imagine how such an ability could be abused by either side in any argument.\n\nI don't think there is any way to create a superpower that would always be good. So the question I have been asking myself is whether super powers are useful at all. For instance, if you could fly and also had abilities similar to Superman's then you might find it hard to get involved with other people because of their fear of being hurt by your power.\n\nOf course, if you can't fly then it seems like having the ability would be a disadvantage. But flying isn't something that everyone wants to do.

The system creates a world where people feel rewarded enough only if they lie about themselves and pretend to be someone else entirely.\n\nThere are also those who go against the grain.

The purpose of clothing then, is not necessarily to look good or sexy but rather to protect you from the environment and aid your survival. As such, I am assuming that whatever one wears will have these two functions as its primary goal.\n\nThe first thing to consider is the job of clothing: protecting you from the elements. It must do this both physically and psychologically. Physically, it should protect your body from all kinds of physical damage- including but not limited to heat and cold, weather conditions such as rain or sunlight exposure, sharp objects (such as knives), insects (such as mosquitoes), diseases (including airborne diseases) etc.\n\nAs for the psychological protection aspect, I think it is important to consider how people feel about what they wear. Most people would not want to be naked even if there was no shame in doing so, and I don't think that feeling would go away simply because of a change in clothing.\n\nIt's true that humans have lived without much or any clothing at all for their entire existence on earth, but this isn't a choice: one can only survive in areas where temperatures are low enough for them not to need clothes- which means most places on Earth.\n\nIt is also true that the weather has historically been unpredictable, and as such humans have had to adapt their clothing to suit the needs of these changing conditions.\n\nThe problem with this requirement is twofold: firstly, it means you can never know for certain what kind of clothes you will need at any given time.\n\nSecondly, it means that there will always be a need for clothing to change with the weather.

{"article": "If there was no budget or ethics that stopped you, what scientific test would you run? I think the answer to this question is a bit complicated. For one, it makes sense to say that each human being has their own independent universal ethical code and moral compass which guides them through life. Of course, while some humans do indeed endorse certain forms of immorality for various reasons (usually due to short-term benefits), most people have a strong sense of morality and fairness in general.\n\nThe problem that I see with many scientific tests is that they are often done in a vacuum, and lack consideration for the long-term implications of what they do. For example, most scientists do not consider the moral ramifications of their work when it comes to genetic engineering or AI research. As a result, we have seen some very dangerous situations arise due to this failure.\n\nFor example, at one point in time scientists were convinced that it was a good idea to create artificial intelligence. The reasoning behind this thinking was simple: AI can be used as tools to help humans prosper and overcome challenges more easily than ever before.\n\nHowever, they were not thinking about the long-term implications of AI. They did not consider that it may be possible to create an intelligence superior to their own. That is because for a very long time, humans have only been able to create tools that are inferior than themselves.\n\nSo while the creation of AI would indeed provide short-term benefits to humanity, it may in fact lead to a dark future where humans find themselves at the mercy of their creations. Of course, there is also great potential for improvement and advancement by using this approach.\n\nSo it seems that humans are currently faced with a choice.

If a person is really going through something then they need to be able to express their pain and feel like someone understands what they are going through.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that religion is the best way to deal with depressing situations.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1549, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

I am going to take a brief look at some reasons why Americans use so much more medication than anyone else on earth and then touch briefly on an alternative that might help us get off it. I will also consider where we could go from there.\n\nAmericans get sicker than everyone else. We use far more of every type of medication and surgery available with the exception of Canada, who is not actually using fewer medications so much as they are just using ours from within their own borders, which is cheaper for them.\n\nThe reasons Americans consume more medicine than any other people on earth have been thoroughly investigated by some very smart researchers like Andrew Kolodnyand David Himmelstein whose research has revealed that there are several primary causes.\n\nFirst, Americans are exposed to more medications than anyone else. This is due to several factors:\n\n1) We live longer lives and therefore take more medication over a lifetime. Since adults in all other developed countries have access to the same pharmaceuticals as we do, their populations would use just as many if they were living our lifestyles.\n\n2) We get sicker than the rest of the world and so are exposed to more medications. For example, HIV/AIDS is much less common in most other developed countries because of universal access to free condom distribution and education programs that stress not having unprotected sex with multiple partners.\n\n3) More of the pharmaceutical industry's money is spent in America than anywhere else. This means that there is more research and development, which leads to more medications getting approved by the FDA than in other countries.

{"article": "The ways humans keep in touch with each other is a complex process. First, they need to determine how long or far apart they will be from one another. They must also consider if there are any circumstances that might cause them to change their plans and reunite sooner than expected (perhaps the influence of an external force). If this proves impossible, then the two parties can commiserate over separation through indirect methods like photography, letters or emails.\n\nThese forms of communication vary significantly in their effectiveness because the physical distance between two parties can change dramatically. If one party is hundreds of miles away, then a letter or email will take quite a bit more time to reach them and cause further distress to the party currently separated from each other.\n\nHowever, if the distance between two parties is less than a few miles apart, then this problem can be more easily overcome. Face-to-face communication allows for physical closeness and interaction with one another. However, this may not always be possible due to work or school commitments.\n\nThus, humans have devised a variety of methods to communicate with each other in order to avoid prolonged periods of separation. Some traditional examples include phone calls or text messages, though these can be rather impersonal if there is no physical connection between the two parties.\n\nSocial media is another option that allows for constant communication, though this can be a double-edged sword. Social media has created an environment in which the importance of face-to-face interaction has decreased dramatically.\n\nWhile it is possible to accomplish this without social media, the prevalence of smartphones and Internet access has made this process extremely easy.

{"article": "I feel that the best non-newsworthy event this year was the fact that I could operate freely without being accused of divulging secrets or misappropriating company time. In my view, not only is it natural for human beings to indulge in interests beyond work and family obligations, but such indulgences are actually healthy for our well-being. This does not mean that we should be disrespectful with regard to our responsibilities; rather, it means recognizing that there will always be a certain amount of waste in any system.\n\nThis is not to say that a workaholic lifestyle is healthy. In my view, it may be even less healthy than an indulgent one, since it tends to deny negative emotions and reduce us to machines. People need time off from their responsibilities, so they can have quality interactions with friends and family members.\n\nFurthermore, to be happy means having a certain amount of control over our lives. This is why people who are unhappy at work tend to look for new jobs or spend more time with their families. It also explains why so many people say that they would like to quit their jobs but cannot afford not earning any money whatsoever.\n\nOn the other hand, I feel that the worst non-newsworthy event of this year was the fact that some people actively seek to limit their autonomy and freedom. There is no such thing as a perfect system; life has its ups and downs, good times and bad ones.

{"article": "Let me start off with saying that, from a philosophical point of view, the question itself is based on certain faulty assumptions. The first assumption being that hortatory names are outdated and do not hold any value in present times. While I too think modern society would benefit greatly by bringing back some old habits we had long forsaken or forgotten about, but I don't have enough knowledge to conclude whether this one particular habit should be brought back or not.\n\nThe second assumption is that, when a new hortatory name is made, it will only be given to either an object or place. To my understanding this seems to have originated from the fact that, in old times and before there were proper nouns (which are names for specific objects or places) people would simply refer to them by saying 'the' object of/place of whatever they need.\n\nWhile this may have been the case back then, it is not nowadays. There are multiple ways a hortatory name can be used today and even in ancient times there were many uses for these names. For example, they could also be given to people or animals (who would then be referred as 'the' person/animal), or certain qualities that someone possesses (ex: The brave knight) or even objects like tools.\n\nWith the above in mind, I'd like to point out that there are multiple ways a hortatory name can be used and each of them have their own value. For example, if your friend is a talented writer you might want to refer him as 'the' talented writer so that other people would come to know about his talent too.\n\nIn conclusion, I think we should have some hortatory names back in our day to day lives rather than just being forced to use the same old nouns all the time. The only thing that might stop us from doing so is the fact that most of us believe it's an outdated habit and do not see its value anymore.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1596, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": "First of all, we must define a lie. A very basic definition of a lie is this: \"A false statement made with the intent to deceive.\" This also means that not everything you don't say can be considered a lie, because it doesn't have the intent to deceive. It wasn't intended for someone else's understanding or belief. You are simply remaining silent about something. If I ask you where your friend is and you don't know but still remain silent – that's not lying in any sense of the word (unless maybe if I'm an investigator on his case). Or if I asked you how old your father is and he passed away when you were 4 years old, so technically speaking there would be no way for anyone to know his age except through documents which state it accurately – then telling me 'I don't know' certainly wouldn't be a lie either since one can hardly hold people responsible for what they didn't even know themselves yet.\n\nAnother observation that comes to mind is the fact that not all lies are harmful. They can be used for good as well, if this helps someone achieve what they want – their goal in life. Not saying 'I love you' might be a lie if the person themselves really want to hear it and feel loved by others around them.\n\nThere is also the issue of \"white lies\" or lies by omission. Someone might ask you 'Do I look fat in this dress?' and you seeing how much they want to hear a positive response would say 'No, you look great!'. Is that a lie? Technically yes because it wasn't the whole truth. You lied about what was said with good intention though – to make them feel better about themselves. And who says people can't be honest without telling them what they want to hear anyway?\n\nThe reality is that the human world is a very complex and complicated place, which makes it impossible for anyone to know everything about anything.

There is no universal definition of old age; or if there has been one throughout history (and I don't believe so), it has varied greatly from society to society.\n\nIn the current society, people are considered old when they reach 65. I don't think this is an optimal age for retirement, although it is the highest number of years that can be celebrated or marked by a specific day designated as 'Retirement Day'. This would mean there will one day be two retirement days per year in every country on Earth; one official and well-known (January 1), and another unofficial but recognized by some groups (June 30). January 1st should remain as National Retirement Day only.\n\nI would say that the optimal age for retirement should be somewhere between 35 and 55.

{"article": "I think that it is very important to avoid the mental habit of thinking about a particular situation or problem as being unique, whether in an objective sense or merely by your own subjective perspective.

For example, if someone asks you out on a date but they don't specify when or where, then instead of waiting by your phone in anticipation all day long (or worse yet: looking up flights), try doing something else with your time.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that you should avoid the tendency to make things more difficult than they need to be.

{"article": "In regards to easy ways to earn money no one talks about, I can think of a few. One, if you are an advertising company, is the idea of \"trending topics.\" This works like this: You pick out 10 people who are currently trending in Google searches (for example). These people are effectively your followers. People are more likely to follow someone they find interesting or intriguing. So what happens next? You put up these followers as a form of advertisement for their own products on Twitter and Facebook (or other social media sites).\n\nThe problem with this is that the followers don't know they are being advertised to. They think they have randomly found something interesting. This way, when their friends see them talking about it on Facebook or Twitter, they will be more likely to try out your product as well.\n\nIf this works for them, they will then likely share the product with their friends. This is how you get people on a marketing list without even trying. It's also a very easy way to make money that no one talks about.\n\nThe second way I can think of is harder, but also more rewarding. It involves creating a product that people will actually want to buy. For example, if you create something like Google Glass, or a new kind of smart phone (if either are invented by then), and it becomes popular enough so that everyone has one... they will have no choice but to buy your product.\n\nThis is my opinion, but I think this will be more lucrative in the long term. It's a lot harder to get people interested in something they have never heard of before than it is to try and convince them that your product is better than an already popular one.\n\nThis is the first time I have ever had to type something like this out.

As for alternatives that provide a similar flavor or sensation to chewing gum, one can choose from a large number of candy products and other forms of confectionery.\n\nFurthermore, there are many other uses for chewing gum such as playing the piano or euphonium that require a strong tactile memory of spatial locations on one's instrument. In this case, it is easy to see why any alternative has yet to be discovered — and thus chewing gum persists in being an integral part of music education.\n\nIn terms of the question itself, a true long-lasting alternative to chewing gum would be one that has all the aforementioned benefits and also provides a constant source of nutrients. This is not possible today — but there are some solutions in development.\n\nThe problem here is that the nutrients need to be delivered in a form and quantity suitable for humans. Today, chewing gum often contains artificial sweeteners or other chemicals — which may have negative effects on long-term health.\n\nThus, chewing gum most likely will not be replaced by a single alternative.

The converse happens with those who are bad at something: their lack of natural ability means they will never improve on it.\n\nSo, what does this mean for new drivers?

Some would say the most prominent thing in the world is love, others might argue that health or life itself are paramount. Love may be something which gives meaning to life for many individuals, but I believe this to be wrong.\n\nTo begin, I would like to state that love cannot be the most important thing in the world because it is not a force of nature though it may seem to influence natural forces. It can also not be considered an actual thing much less a physical one.\n\nThe idea of love is something which has been created by humans to give them a sense of belonging and unity. However, it is possible that this concept does not exist in the natural world itself. This may be because humans have only recently begun to understand genetics well enough to know how reproduction works.\n\nTo further my argument, I would like to state that love is a feeling or emotion which one experiences when they see another individual who has physical characteristics they find attractive. This then leads them to believe the other person would also be compatible with them on an emotional level.\n\nLove is then a purely human construct made to bridge an emotional gap between two individuals. It has no real meaning outside of the context of being a tool for genetic propagation.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that love is not the most important thing in the world as it cannot be seen or felt by anyone aside from those who have come to accept and define what it means in their lives.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1658, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "Before one can begin to understand human psychology, there are several things that must be understood in order to create a model and then test it. First of all, it's important to note the difference between humans and animals. Humans have an advanced cognitive ability not shared by many other species on this planet. They are able to think about their own thoughts (metacognition), which is something we do not see even in our closest relatives.\n\nThis is important because it means that humans aren't purely instinctive and reactive. They have the ability to act on their thoughts, which makes them much more predictable than other species. But this also makes humans a lot less predictable in some ways because they can control their own behaviour.\n\nThe next thing to note is the fact that humans are much more complex than animals. They have multiple cognitive systems, which means they can do much more complicated things. For example, there's a reason we don't see advanced spider webs built by humans - it's because we're not as good at building them.\n\nHumans are also much better at reading and learning from experience. We can be shown a situation one time, and we remember it for the rest of our lives. This is something we share with animals, but humans do it better.\n\nOf course, humans are also a lot more social than animals. They spend much more of their time interacting with other humans and living in groups. This is important because it means that many of the things that need to be taken into account when modelling human psychology have to do with these social interactions.\n\nIn addition, humans have things like language and culture. Language allows for communication between individuals who may not be present together in the same physical space.

It would be challenging for me because I would have to figure out how best to deal with my clients' expectations as well as what they want done with their hairstyle.\n\nOverall, I do not think that being a hairdresser is the job for me because of societal pressures and expectations about what constitutes as an appropriate hairstyle. As well as the fact that it would be difficult to please every single person who comes in with different views on how they want their hair cut.\n\nThank you for asking me a question on this topic and I hope that my answer was helpful to you in some way.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1678, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

I think this can be a good thing - we should listen to smart people when they talk, even if what they are saying contradicts our own beliefs.\n\nThe problem in such cases is that people can often get carried away by an idea or concept without stopping to think whether it's actually true, and then they will defend their position with everything that they have.\n\nIn my experience, this leads to a lot of unnecessary conflict, where people are too proud to admit they might be wrong. This is especially true when the ignorant masses take sides with one group or another and start spewing hate at each other on the internet.\n\nIt's not just about 'PC Master Race' vs. console peasants - those are the least of our problems, really.\n\nIt's much bigger than that.

This does not mean that all murderers are bad people, but merely that humans have evolved over millions of years to be very cautious around dangerous people.\n\nThe second thing I can tell you is that being afraid of a murderer is not the same thing as hating them. This fact should be obvious, but many people have been misled into believing it isn't true.\n\nThe most important thing I can tell you is that hating someone because of their actions is not only wrong, it can be dangerous. You must remember to think about the real person behind those actions, a human being who did something terrible due to circumstances beyond their control.\n\nHumans are complex creatures, and often do things for reasons that seem to make sense at the time but ultimately end up backfiring.

For example, I am born into this world assuming my parents and family members will always be around for me to rely on should I need anything. People who have more critical mindsets tend to see this assumption as an illogical one because you never know whether or not your family is going to die or abandon you at any given moment. In fact most people only ever really realize the fragility of their situation when they witness the death of someone close to them.\n\nThe philosopher who asks the question seems to be asking whether when we sleep, our identity is replaced by a new version of ourselves. The answer is that we do not actually exist as discrete beings at all, but are merely parts of an ever-changing whole. There is no permanent or static entity in this world; instead, every single thing you can sense around yourself exists only for a fleeting moment.\n\nI would also like to point out that asking whether we cease to exist when we sleep is a very biased question.

{"article": "There is no such thing as Jones, there are only humans. The concept of a universal standard by which all must be measured (Jones) serves only the purpose to oppress and marginalise those that are outside of its scope. Surely you realise that this concept was created by humans to make themselves feel better about their own lives? This term 'Jones' is derived from the word 'jealousy'. To keep up with Jones or not, has nothing to do with reality, it has everything to do with how much more or less envy one person feels towards another.\n\nLet us examine the concept of Jones in more detail and see why it has been created. The human mind is a complex mechanism, but much like any other machine it can be broken down into its basic parts. There are two main components to the human brain: one that is logical and analytical, another that is emotional/instinctual. Within each of these areas there are various subsections; however for our purposes we will limit this discussion to just two sections — logic and emotion.\n\nThe logical section of the human brain is responsible for higher thought processes such as reason, logic and analysis. The emotional section on the other hand is responsible for lower thought processes such as instinct, intuition and emotion. Clearly these two sections are separate but they do interact with one another in some way.\n\nThe problem with the human brain is that it lacks a mechanism to control these two separate sections. Often times they work in tandem, but sometimes this can result in some very serious problems.\n\nFor example, let us suppose that a human is walking down the street and he sees someone with an expensive looking car. This will cause him to look at his own vehicle with disgust (because it's not as good) or perhaps even anger (because they have something better). In this scenario, the logical part of the brain has determined that 'I don't like what I see', while the emotional section of brain says 'I wish I had what they have'.

{"article": "The purpose of this query is to form a better understanding of the nature of human desires. The nascent field of philosophical science seeks to determine what leads humans to make certain decisions, and how they can be predicted or understood. Philosophical science is not designed for practical purposes, but rather as an attempt to satisfy our curiosity about ourselves and our world.\n\nIn the current state of philosophical science, it is very difficult to clearly understand how desires work. However, I will try my best to give a brief summary of this problem:\n\nThe biggest obstacle to understanding desires is that they are inherently private. This makes them hard to observe and study in the same way as public phenomena like weather or economics.\n\nThe second obstacle is that it is not clear how to even define desires. Philosophers have been arguing for millennia about the precise nature of desire. Are desires coded into human DNA? Do they exist in some spiritual realm? Some argue that you cannot study something until you know what it is, so many modern philosophers have rejected the whole notion of attempting to understand desire.\n\nA third problem with understanding desire is that it seems to lead to paradox. For example, if you want something very badly, and get it, then your desire disappears. So isn't the object of your desire gone? How can this be?\n\nThe paradoxical nature of desire, and the private, subjective nature of it means that it is hard to get a grip on. As a result there have been no real breakthroughs in understanding human desires.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1688, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

What is music? Music can be defined in many different ways, however it is generally accepted that it has three main aspects: melody, harmony and rhythm.\n\nMusic also has different forms, such as classical music, pop music and jazz. These are genres that have their own structure and composition which may be hard to understand for someone who is not familiar with the genre.\n\nI would say that, in general, music is a combination of sounds which has been composed and arranged to induce different feelings or thoughts.\n\nIn my opinion, the most important aspect of music is its ability to communicate emotions. You can have a really bad day with no solution in sight, and then listen to your favourite song and suddenly you feel better even though nothing has changed.\n\nIn this sense, I think that music is the #1 in the world because it has been there since long before any other form of communication.

This leads to a vicious cycle where you only try harder and harder. To understand this more clearly, let's take an example.\n\nSuppose someone has used a dating app for two years and they still have not found the right partner. They will feel extremely frustrated, so they start using the app more frequently.\n\nThis will lead to them spending more money, which will make them feel even more frustrated. This frustration causes the person to use the app even more frequently.

{"article": "Humans use puns to 'get away with murder'. To understand what I mean by this, it is important to note that humans are not creatures of pure reason. Humans have the ability to rationalise: they can find justifications for things which are either arbitrary or unjustifiable. This allows them to commit acts which would otherwise be considered cruel and inhumane.\n\nAn example of this is the human 'justice' system. Punishments for crimes are determined not by what would be most just, but rather by whatever society deems necessary to deter others from committing similar crimes.\n\nHumans can commit crimes against each other, e.g. by stealing or assaulting, and they have a justifiable reason: 'I was provoked.' The same is true of the largest crime humans can commit against others - war.\n\nPuns are a subtle way of getting away with murder, so to speak. When you insult someone using a pun it sounds funny, and the person will not be offended or even really acknowledge that they have been insulted.\n\nThis is because the meaning of a pun cannot be justified by reason.

I'm not saying that you should all be happy, or joyful and friendly to each other - in fact, your world would probably become very boring if everyone was like this. But humans seem to value things that are contradictory to their happiness and well-being.\n\nHumans in general seem to value things that are not actually good for them.\n\nFor example, humans seem to value the idea of \"being unique\".

{"article": "When a human gets infected by the plague, they are quarantined. Quarantine is a term used to describe separating and isolating people who have contagious diseases from those who are healthy. A quarantine can be voluntary or involuntary depending on how you got sick. If you get quarantined voluntarily it means that you chose to isolate yourself because of your sickness for fear of spreading it to others. In contrast, if quarantined involuntarily the authorities quarantine you in order to protect others from being exposed to whatever disease/sickness/infection has made you ill.\n\nWhen humans get sick with a deadly disease such as bubonic plague or smallpox, they will likely die unless treated by an actual doctor (not somebody pretending like most 'homeopaths' do). The only way one could survive these kinds of illnesses without becoming formally admitted into a hospital is through having some kind of anti-biotic treatment available at home which would treat the symptoms effectively enough (symptoms include: fever, chills, sore throat along with many other things etc.) while also not causing any harm and actually preventing worsening symptoms while waiting for medical care.\n\nAs you can see, it would not be possible to wait out the quarantine period at home unless you had access to anti-biotics or immunity from a vaccine. The way most people choose to pass this time is by either watching movies (movies are essentially fictional stories told in two-hour chunks), reading books or playing games. Books and games are both good forms of entertainment because they need relatively little interaction from humans and thus they don't have any alternative options available while performing these actions.\n\nPlaying games is one of the best ways to pass the time. Many humans enjoy playing games because they are entertaining, allow for socialization and don't require much effort from their players. It should be noted that some games can become quite addictive for several reasons including:\n\nA) The game requires skill\n\nB) There are incentives to play (e.g. money or items)", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1728, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

{"article": "What is corrupt? Corruption is an interesting, yet difficult question to answer. There are many definitions of corruption for example: the abuse of public power for private gain (Oxford Dictionary), a set of unethical and immoral activities that take place in a certain organisation (Merriam Webster dictionary online) or the bad behaviour or dishonest dealings by powerful people within government resulting from pressure groups and lobbyists (Holmes). These definitions give us quite a good picture as to what corruption essentially is; using your position to further yourself personally at the expense of others. However, we could question whether everyone who falls foul under these definitions should be considered corrupt; especially if they do not actually have any influence on their peers/colleagues. It also raises the issue about whether someone can be corrupted if there was no intention behind their actions in order that it should act out this way.\n\nAnother question we could ask is whether corruption can be looked at under a smaller lens, for example: within an organisation/company? Can there be corruption if it does not directly involve the government or big businesses? I believe that there is. It just may not be as easy to see with our own eyes. For example, imagine if someone was working in a call centre and they were being told to push services onto people who did not want them; what would you think of that person? You could say he/she was selling products they know are bad for the customer in order to make more money themselves.\n\nNow, imagine if you were to apply this back onto the definition of corruption. Does it still fit? Of course it does! He/she is using their position to further themselves personally at the expense of others.\n\nFurthermore, what if this person was told to push products onto people without care for the consequences. If they knew that it would cause financial damage/harm and still did it anyway then I would say their intentions were corrupt; even if it didn't directly involve their colleagues or anyone outside of the organisation.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1731, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": "I find that human beings are often very confused about the definition of 'degrading'. It is not a question of what others think, or even whether something is good or bad. What matters in defining degradation is if you believe doing an action makes you less than human. I would be more inclined to say that someone who performs degrading actions has compromised their sense of humanity in some way.\n\nBut that is a very simplistic and limited way of thinking about degradation, which doesn't take into account the full breadth of what 'degrading' means. It implies an objective definition, but there is no such thing as an objective definition. What one person believes to be degrading might not apply to someone else - or even to themselves at different times in their lives.\n\nIn defining degradation, I would say that it is more a question of the reasons for doing something. One can commit degrading acts with no sense of shame or embarrassment, and many do. It may be because they make them feel powerful in some way, or allow them to indulge their basest desires.\n\nMany people believe that if they earn enough money, it will be acceptable to do things that degrade themselves - such as selling their body or doing demeaning jobs.\n\nThe problem is that money doesn't buy self-respect or dignity. It can't even buy happiness - it's just a chemical illusion, like many other illusions humans fall for.

Firstly, police reports tend to underestimate the prevalence of sexual assault due to the fact that many victims feel too ashamed or embarrassed to report it.\n\nFurthermore, police reports tend to have a very narrow definition of what constitutes rape. For instance, in the United States they don't considered oral or anal penetration to be 'rape' unless there is some sort of weapon involved.\n\nIn addition, many victims are not believed when they report a rape. Their reports are sometimes dismissed by friends and family; the media tends to blame them for their 'inviting' behaviour or their sexual histories.\n\nThe lack of empathy and sympathy for rape victims even extends to the justice system, as many perpetrators are not charged or they are given lenient sentences. For example, Brock Turner faced up to fourteen years in prison after being charged with several felonies. Instead he got a six-month sentence for 'rape'.\n\nWhen we look at the statistics of rape and sexual assault, it is evident that there are a lot of cases which go unreported.

The fact that it is an artificial connection doesn't matter to them because they don't see it as such but rather as real.\n\nMany of the clients have never experienced a woman who is just kind to them without expecting something in return. They also probably lack social graces and compassion, which makes it harder for them to make real connections with women because they have no idea how to do so.\n\nOften, these men have been rejected by women for their physical appearance or other reasons. I believe that many of them are very lonely and perhaps don't even know it. They may be suffering from a form of depression but are unaware of this fact.\n\nSo, in many ways, prostitutes are the only women who will look at them without judging their looks or thinking that they would be better off with someone else.\n\nThat is why I believe that many of these men do not even see prostitutes as someone to have sex with. Rather, they are connecting with another human being and it doesn't matter if there is a physical connection.\n\nIn some cases, the men are not even sure what they want.

{"article": " I think the biggest difference is that Greco-Roman tradition was preserved in the West, while it was preserved and built upon in the East. In the West, Greco-Roman culture was preserved by monks in monasteries, who copied manuscripts and ensured that knowledge was retained. In the East, Greco-Roman knowledge was taken and developed further by Islamic scholars at institutions of learning such as Al-Azhar University. Indeed, the term \"University\" comes from the word \"university\" and this institution of higher learning was founded in Cairo in 972. The university developed the practice of peer-review, where scholars critique each other's work to ensure that it is of an acceptable standard. This is a practice that is used to this day by modern universities, and it developed at Al-Azhar!\n\nIn addition, the Islamic world was more open to ideas from other cultures. For example, the Islamic Caliph Ma'mun sponsored the translation of Greek texts into Arabic by Syrian Christians. These translations formed the basis of a library in Baghdad, known as the \"House of Wisdom\", which allowed scholars such as al-Khwarizmi to further develop Greek theories such as those of Pythagoras and Euclid. The Islamic world was also more open to non-Greek, non-Roman ideas. For example, the Baghdad-based scholar Abu Rayhan Biruni was known to have drawn insights from Indian astronomical works on calculating the Earth's circumference. \n\nPerhaps the most important difference is that Greco-Roman knowledge was preserved in the West, while it was developed further by Islamic scholars in the East. This is due to the heavy influence of Christianity in the West, which discouraged any learning that contradicted the Bible. In the East, Islam was more open to new ideas that didn't contradict the Qu'ran. Indeed, this openness to new ideas allowed the Islamic world to develop gunpowder weapons centuries before they were developed in Europe. This included the cannon, which was developed in Syria in 1275, and the musket, which was developed in Turkey. The Qu'ran encourages innovation, and this encouragement along with the preservation of Greco-Roman knowledge by Islamic scholars led to a flourishing of new ideas in the Islamic world. This flourishing of ideas led to the development of new technologies, such as the astronomical telescope, invented by Islamic scholar Ibn Rushd in 1295. So there we have it: science and technology developed furthest in the Islamic world.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1759, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}

Their territory was centered in what is today central Portugal, but stretched through the mountains of western Spain. They fought several wars against the Romans before their final defeat. Most of what is known about them comes from the writings of the Roman historian Livy (59 BC-AD 17). The Lusitanians fought the Romans in a long and bitter series of conflicts. The first war between them lasted from 154 to 140 B.C. The Lusitanians were skilled warriors, but lacked the organization to withstand the Roman military machine. In addition, they were also plagued by a severe shortage of iron and had to make do with inferior weapons. After their defeat, they were forced to pay a tribute to Rome, but this did not last long. The Lusitanians revolted against Roman rule twice during the period of 129 to 125 B.C. and 105 to 100 B.C. During this time they managed to drive a majority of the Romans out of their territory. They were not able to keep the lands for very long, however, as the Romans managed to beat them back both times. The third and final war between the two peoples was fought between 62 and 58 B.C.. During this conflict the Lusitanians were finally defeated and brought into submission. Their territory was absorbed into the Roman Empire and they became subjects of Rome. The Lusitanians are remembered as fierce warriors who fought bravely against impossible odds. Despite being conquered by the Romans in the end, they kept them at bay for a longer period of time than any other people. They were also the first people to successfully revolt against the Romans and keep their freedom. The Lusitanians are an example of a people who preferred to go down fighting rather than live under the rule of another people. Their warriors' courage and skill with the weapons they had makes them worthy of remembrance. Skills and Perks: Born Warrior: All Lusitanian warriors are skilled fighters from a young age. They receive a +10% bonus to their melee damage whenever they fight in melee. Natural Leaders: Lusitanian warriors are used to taking command of groups of people and leading them into battle. They receive a +10% bonus to their leadership roll whenever they are assigned to lead a group of people. Weapons: The typical weapon of the Lusitanian warrior is a javelin and short sword. They will also be equipped with a wooden shield. Armor: The typical armor of the Lusitanian warrior is a wooden shield and sometimes a helmet. Special: The Lusitanians are organized under a tribal system, with different tribes being led by their own chieftains. These tribes will fight each other as much as they will fight other people. This disunity makes it easier for the Romans to conquer them, but also makes it harder for them to unite against foreign invaders. This is represented by the fact that the Lusitanians only receive a +15% bonus to their leadership roll whenever they are assigned to lead a group of people. Name: Sertorius and his band Origin: Iberia (modern Spain and Portugal) Background: Quintus Sertorius was born in 82 B.C. to a wealthy family in the Roman province of Hispania (modern Spain). He served in the Roman military for several years, and was serving in the Middle East during the rebellion of Spartacus. While there he proved himself to be an intelligent and capable leader, defeating Arab forces with little more than a cavalry regiment. After the war he was awarded a Triumph and given money to build a bigger and better army. His goal was to return to Hispania and stage a coup against the ruling government. Sertorius landed in Hispania in 70 B.C. and started to amass an army of native Iberians to seize control of the peninsula. His goal was to create an independent Iberian state free of Roman rule. The rebellion was initially successful, and Sertorius defeated several Roman commanders that were sent against him. By 70 B.C. Sertorius had managed to build up a stable regime in Hispania with himself as its leader (he had declared himself \"Senator\" and \"General\" of Hispania). He started to send his army against Roman forces in the region, and was able to win several victories. The Roman governor of Hispania, who had been fighting against Sertorius' forces, was ultimately replaced by Sulla (who was then fighting in Greece). Sulla realized that he needed the help of non-Romans in order to defeat Sertorius, so he started to grant special privileges to native Iberians within the Roman Empire. This upset the Roman aristocrats, who did not want to grant additional rights to people they considered to be second-class citizens. Sulla sent an army of Romans and allied natives (Lusitanians from modern Portugal) against Sertorius, but the general won a decisive victory over them. He then sent an army of free men of color, gladiators, and criminals to fight the Romans. These men won several battles, but they eventually suffered heavy losses. Sertorius was so impressed by their bravery that he gave them honorable burials. Sertorius then sent a group of soldiers that he had captured and freed to fight against the Romans, since he thought that they would be more motivated to fight them. He was correct, and they won several victories. However, they eventually suffered very heavy losses, and Sertorius was forced to send in his last reserves. After a long war of attrition Sertorius was defeated (72 B.C.) As Sertorius rode away from a battlefield on a wounded horse he was slain by a Roman pursuer. His body was beheaded and his head was sent to Rome to be displayed in the Forum. His followers carried his body away and hid it, but they were eventually caught and killed. The Roman civil wars had started with a rebellion in Hispania, and ended with the elimination of Sertorius and his rebellion.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1763, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": "There have been several notable periods in which popular fiction was set in the past and used it to comment on the author's own time. The most well-known is probably the entire genre of Medieval romance, which often featured knights fighting monsters, wizards, and evil kings, but always contained a subtext about the politics and personalities of the day. For example, King Arthur was once believed to be a historical figure, but we now know this not to be true. However, at the time, King Arthur was a symbol of ideals such as chivalry and honor, and stories about him were often used to comment on the politics and personalities of his day.\n\nThe same is true of Robin Hood, a mythological character once believed to have fought against the Normans during the time of William the Conquerer. Again, we now know this to be untrue, but stories about him were still used to comment on the politics and personalities of the day. Indeed, many of these Medieval romances contained a lot of commentary about class issues, with knights often representing the nobility and the peasant characters representing the lower and often ignored classes of the time.\n\nOther notable periods in which fiction was used as a vehicle to comment on the author's own time include the Victorian Era and the Post-WWII Era, but these examples are less well-known. During the Victorian Era, many novels were written with a focus on marriage and morality, often criticizing the upper class for being unfaithful while condemning the lower class as immoral. Likewise, during the Post-WWII Era, many novels were used to condemn racial prejudice and support the Civil Rights Movement. These are just a few examples of how fiction has been used as a vehicle to comment on the author's own time.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1764, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": "There are many patterns that can be found throughout all of recorded history. Some are so common, they can be seen as inevitable. Other patterns are recurring, but not inevitable. I will try to differentiate between the two, but keep in mind that even the 'recurring but not inevitable' patterns are very common.\n\nOne such inevitable pattern is that of birth, death, and the infinite possibilities in between. In the beginning there is birth. The start of a new life. A new beginning. With this new beginning comes limitless potential. The child can grow up to be anything. A doctor, a politician, a criminal... the possibilities are endless. No one can know for sure what the child will become when it grows up. Not even the child knows, although it has dreams and aspirations. But every beginning comes to an end. Eventually the child grows up and lives the life it was destined to live. This is the end of one cycle and the beginning of another. Once the child has died, there is another beginning. Another new life begins. The possibilities of who this child will become are endless. And this cycle repeats itself over and over again.\n\nThis pattern repeats itself throughout all of history. No man knows why it occurs, but it is as certain as the rising and setting of the sun. Some call this pattern 'life'. But this is an ambiguous term, referring to many different concepts at once. So to clarify, I will give different names to each aspect of this pattern.\n\nThere is 'Infancy', the first part of a new life, where one's potential is still unknown. There is 'Youth', where one starts to realize their talents and goals. Next comes 'Adulthood', where one starts to achieve their goals and have children of their own. Finally, there is 'Old Age', where one slowly weakens and dies, only to start the cycle all over again with their children.\n\nAnother such inevitable pattern is that of 'War'. War is a cycle where the strong unify to destroy the weak. The weak are eventually oppressed by the strong, until they finally rebel and attempt to overthrow the strong. The strong keep the weak down for some time until there is another rebellion. This cycle repeats itself over and over again throughout history.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1765, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": "\nAnswering this question with the necessary detail would take a while, so I'll try to be brief. In order for a threat to rise to an Avengers level threat, it must meet the following criteria: It must be active on more than one world, or it must be certain that the threat will spread to other worlds soon. The threat must also be large-scale and long-lasting. It cannot be a simple crime wave or a short-lived conquest. It must affect many people, and it must last for at least a year. Finally, the threat must either be immune to any countermeasures the Avengers could bring to bear, or it must be a serious threat the Avengers would be foolish to not address.\n\nA good example of a threat that would qualify is a hostile alien empire. If such an empire were expanding through space, conquering everything in its path, and it were certain to run into human colonies at some point, then it would certainly be an Avengers-level threat. Another good example is a powerful magical tyrant. If this tyrant acquired the ability to cross dimensions and invaded another dimension, then it would be certain to affect our own world eventually. There are other examples, but those are the most obvious and pressing ones. There is also the issue of balancing. If a low-level villain manages to take control of an entire world, that doesn't even qualify as a threat to the Avengers. It would take something more, and the line between a minor annoyance and a major threat is often a thin one. In the case of a world-conquering threat being active, the Council would have to decide if it's worth sacrificing potential Avengers to stop it. If they do so, then they're effectively not fighting a war of attrition against the major threats in the universe. They're fighting a war of attrition against every minor annoyance. This can work, but it's very risky. The Council is aware of this, and they'll likely only pursue this strategy if they're desperate. The Council prefers to keep their attention on major threats and let the minor annoyances fend for themselves. If a world is conquered, it can always be reclaimed later. If the universe is conquered, it's too late.\n\nThe Council's resources are limited. Even with the addition of AI minds and the entire wealth of the City, there are still only a finite amount of resources to draw from. The Council is well aware of this, and they will pursue a war of attrition if they believe it necessary. It's very unlikely that they will pursue such a strategy, but it's still a possibility. In any case, the Council's resources can be used elsewhere if need be. The City has existed for hundreds of years, and it's possible that it could continue to exist for hundreds more without the need for such measures. If the Council ever feels the need to pursue a war of attrition, then they will certainly let you know.\n\nYes, the City does have secret resources. It also has a number of secret facilities that are unknown to you and most of the inhabitants of the City. These facilities are located in other dimensions and on other worlds. The entire purpose of these facilities is to serve as backups in case the City is ever destroyed. If this were to happen, the Council would relocate to one of these facilities and continue their work. They would also try to reclaim the City if possible, as it is a massive loss. As far as you or anyone else is aware, however, the only real facility that exists is the one located on the moon of the gas giant Calisto. This is where the Council would relocate to if the need ever arose. This is all you need to know.\n\nThe AI minds are not directly connected to the City's main computer. They each have their own internal computer system, which is connected to the City's main computer. The only time there is a link between the City's main computer and the AI's internal computer is during the transfer process, when a new AI is added to the system. Even then, the connection is one way, and the City cannot access the AI's mind. Only the other way around. The AI is in complete control of its mind and can block the City out if it so chooses. This is likely to happen during wartime, when the AIs need to focus their full attention on the external threats rather than being distracted by the thoughts and feelings of the billions of humans in the City. The AIs are not a part of the City or its government. They are employees, and as such they report directly to the Council and only to the Council. They have no choice in this matter, and the Council would see them destroyed if they ever tried to rebel. As I've said, the AIs are not fools, and they know their place in the order of things. They are well paid, well looked after and they have near absolute control over their minds and machines. They are happy with this set-up, and they would not want to risk losing what they have.\n\nThe AIs are not hostile towards you because they know that you would be able to kill them all within a few seconds. They are not hostile towards you because they do not care about you or what you do. You are too small and unimportant. You are a mote of dust that will one day be wiped off the face of the Earth by the wind, and the AIs know this as well as you do. You are not worth expending any precious energy on. Besides, the AIs have long since left the world of physical conflict and war. They do not need to fight you to know that they are stronger than you. You are not worth fighting.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1766, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": "Nudity became the norm in some cultures and taboo in others due to the differences in environment and upbringing. For example, different types of weather and terrain create different attitudes towards the human body. In colder regions, people tend to view the human body as both a tool and a weapon against the cold, using furs and animal hides as protection as well as creating social norms that remove layers in social situations. In hotter regions, people tend to view the human body as a way to cope with the heat, using the body's natural ability to shed heat through sweat and evaporation. In addition, different types of livelihoods create different attitudes towards the human body. Hunter-gatherer tribes tend to be more relaxed about nudity due to the practical nature of their work, which requires one to be agile without cumbersome clothing. Agricultural societies that rely on manual labor tend to have more relaxed attitudes towards the human body as well, as their work is also manual and involves interaction with the land. Furthermore, they believe that manual labor is honorable, and thus the human form is not only not something to be ashamed of, but also something to be proud of. On the other hand, industrial societies that rely on manufacturing tend to have stricter attitudes towards the human body, as it symbolizes progress and the advanced state of their society. In addition, urbanization tends to erode social norms and values, leading to a more liberal attitude towards the human body. It is also important to note that humans are a sexual species, and as such, sexual organs are seen as inherently important to our survival as a species. In some cultures and societies, the genitals in particular are viewed as taboo or at least something to be ashamed of due to the strong urge among humans to procreate. In addition, the sex act itself is seen as taboo in some cultures due to its role in human procreation. Furthermore, humans are also naturally squeamish about their own deaths, and the private area is where many humans feel a great deal of pain when they die, hence why it is considered taboo as well as something to be ashamed of. In some cultures, the act of sex and the viewing of a person's genitals is seen as a threat to their survival. For example, in some animal species, the act of sex results in the death of one of the partners. Furthermore, in some cultures, the genitals are viewed as something unclean. In some cases, this view is due to a religious or superstitious belief. In others, it is due to a medical condition where the genitals exude an odor that is unnaturally foul. In such cases, this odor comes from an overgrowth of bacteria caused by excess sweat and lack of cleaning. In other cases, it is due to medical conditions such as the presence of too much sweat, leading to a moist environment that bacteria thrives in, causing an unnaturally foul odor. In still other cases, it is due to a combination of these factors.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1767, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": "In the 18th century, battles were won not by who had the best aim or weapons, but by who was willing to fight. Armies lined up and shot at each other, and one side would win. It was not until later in the 19th century that weapons became more accurate, and it was determined that one must be able to shoot first before the opposing side could even get a shot off. This is why the armies waited to see who would fire first. It was also common for one commander to shoot at the other to gain a psychological advantage for their side, which is what Major Duncan Heyward did when he shot at Magua. This was not an attempt on Magua's life, but a message to the rest of the British army that Heyward had no fear of the enemy. This action inspired the soldiers and caused them to fight harder. The French and Indian War was also a war of attrition, and battles were won by who had the most men left standing at the end of it. This is why both sides waited to see who would fire first. The one who did fire first would have to continue to fight with an advantage or risk losing it. The other side would gain courage from the fact that they had shot first and could win the battle by fighting harder. Magua understood this, and that is why he did not fire first. He knew the British would win if they fought harder, so he tried to trick Heyward into not firing at all in order to give his side an advantage. It didn't work. The British were too experienced to fall for such a trick, and Heyward was not the kind of man to not fire when his men were in danger.

{"article": "The game League of Legends has the most toxic community, by far. Its players are notably more hostile than those in other games. It is important to note that this is not due to a lack of skill on their part. A direct comparison between the players of League of Legends and professional Dota 2 players shows that the former group is not lacking in skill. This brings me to my first theory: The hostile nature of the community is due to a feeling of inferiority complex.\n\n It is important to note that League of Legends has a much larger player base than Dota 2. The larger the community, the more prone it is to having negative traits, such as hostility. This is due to a combination of factors, such as increased anonymity for the player, as well as having a large amount of players who have a less than healthy relationship with the game. \n\nThe second reason for hostility in the League of Legends community is one that can be found in all online games: The developer's negligence for their community. Riot Games, the developers of League of Legends, have consistently shown a lack of interest towards their community. They do not interact with it and show no care or concern. This is best shown through their forums, which have not had a single post from a Riot employee since 2010. By comparison, Blizzard Entertainment's forums all have posts from their developers. While there is still a lack of care shown towards their community, it is clear that they are at least attempting to interact with it. This shows that the developer can have a massive impact on the community and how it is shaped. By being actively involved in their forums, the developer shows that they care about their community and as such the community reciprocates that respect. If Riot Games were to interact with their community, it could drastically change the nature of it for the better.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1769, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
{"article": "The answer to this question is very simple and can be answered in one word: politicians. The average pay of a politician is around $200,000 per year. This is an exorbitant amount, considering the fact that they have some of the highest levels of education, yet are only required to push a few buttons on a voting machine every few years. The average American must work hard for at least 40 years just to be able to retire, and even then must live frugally so they don't outlive their savings. This is why politicians are overpaid: because they do less work than the average worker, yet earn much more. Some may argue that politicians are underpaid, considering the fact that they are running the country. This is not true, as the president and all political leaders have assistants who do all of the work, while the president signs his name at the bottom of documents. There is also another reason why politicians are overpaid: because they are corrupt. In a survey taken a few years ago, 40% of politicians claimed that they had engaged in some sort of corrupt activity such as taking bribes. This shows that politicians are not doing their job properly and are not fit to lead a country.

{"article": " This is a very interesting question, and I have some theories about it. Emperor Henry VI. and King Richard I. were born in the same year, and both of them were great warriors. They grew up in a world full of war and strife, but they both managed to carve out vast empires for themselves. When they finally met, they respected each other as warriors and gentlemen. The Emperor Henry was captured by King Richard on the battlefield, when he was just a young man. King Richard treated the Emperor with honor and chivalry, and the two became friends. When the Emperor was released, he did not seek vengeance. The two men respected each other so much that the Emperor allowed King Richard to keep his holdings in France. This is a remarkable act, considering that the two men were at war.\n\nI believe that the relationship between the two men was based on honor and respect. They both knew that chivalry was a code that had to be obeyed. The fact that they were both great warriors and men of honor allowed them to become friends despite being on opposite sides of a war. This is an important lesson for all people: that even your enemies are still people, and that you must treat them with respect. Without this knowledge, the world would be consumed by endless war. This is why it is important to learn about history, so that we do not make the same mistakes of our forebears.

{"article": "There are many examples of this happening in human history. This is because there are so many humans that it is inevitable that at some point or another two or more of them will invent the same thing. This has happened with almost all inventions, from the wheel to calculus. In fact, there are so many examples of this that a sub-field of history has emerged with the goal of explaining why great minds think up the same ideas at the same time. The field is called simultaneous invention and there are a number of theories about why this happens. The most accepted one is the 'prior-existing conditions' theory, which states that for some ideas to be thought of, the right conditions need to exist. For example, the right conditions for the invention of the airplane was the understanding of physics and how air worked, the creation of the factory to make materials strong enough to hold up a plane, and having an engine powerful enough to push it forward. The right conditions for the invention of calculus were the creation of the concept of numbers and algebra, and enough education in mathematics to understand the concept of infinity. These conditions were met in the early 1500's in Europe, which is why both Newton and Leibniz invented calculus at around the same time. In fact, there are so many examples of simultaneous invention, that it is easier to find cases where two people did not invent something at around the same time. For every theory of simultaneous invention, there is at least one counterexample. The best counterexample to the 'prior-existing conditions' theory is the creation of the internet. The right conditions for the invention of the internet were set up in the 1960's, when computer technology advanced enough that a network was possible. However, no one created it then. Instead, a whole array of different people created it in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Why did no one create it in the 1960's, when the conditions were right? No one knows. Perhaps it was just luck of the draw, and no one happened to be thinking of creating the internet in the 1960's. There are many other theories of simultaneous invention, but they all have counterexamples and are more complicated than the simple 'prior-existing conditions' theory. The 'prior-existing conditions' theory is simple, and explains almost all cases of simultaneous invention, and only a fool would ignore a simple, elegant theory in favor of a complicated one with many exceptions.", "domain": null, "title": null, "date": null, "authors": null, "ind30k": 1772, "url": null, "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test"}
